A sanctuary for rope as ritual, connection over performance, and consent as sacred practice.

<p class="hx-text-xl hx-text-gray-600 hx-mb-8">
Rope as ritual. Connection over performance. Consent as sacred practice.
</p>

## 📅 Wed–Sun, 18–22 Feb 2026 (Mol, BE)

**🎫 €169 • Limited to 42 people**  
_[Tickets available December 1st, 2025](/docs/practical/participation)_

## New here? Welcome.

If you've been with us before — welcome back to the warmth of connection.  
If this is your first gathering — breathe deep. You're exactly where you need to be.

This isn't a gathering for spectators. It's a sanctuary. For the curious. For the brave enough to be vulnerable. A space where desire whispers — never demands. Where rope is an invitation — never an obligation.

Five days to shed the rush. To sink into something slower, softer, more essential.

Come to tie. Come to surrender. Come to discover what lives in the spaces between.

## Being Together: Our Shared Agreements

**We made a few agreements to keep this space honest, safe, and kind.**

- **Consent comes first, always.** Get it clearly, give it freely, and tune in to words and silence. Be grateful when someone trusts you with their truth.
- **Respect the humans around you.** Every person here carries a story. Be mindful, be curious, ask before touching, and honor pronouns.
- **Speak what's real.** Say what you mean and hear what's said. When things feel tender, choose clarity as a form of care.
- **Stay present.** Let the outside world wait. Be here with your body, your breath, and your attention.
- **Own your impact.** We all fuck up; what matters is what you do next. Apologize, repair, learn, and grow.
- **Play with awareness.** Kink, sex, and BDSM are welcome here, but never at the cost of safety or consent. Know your edges, respect others', and be gentle with power.
- **Take care of yourself.** Eat, hydrate, rest, and ask for what you need. You're not here to push through—you're here to be whole.

### Generosity as Love in Action

**Be generous.**  
Offer what you can: your time, your skills, your mischief, your warmth.

What counts as participation? All of it.

- Chopping onions
- Hanging lights
- Tidying the space
- Holding someone who needs to cry
- Tying rope, sharing a song, offering your favorite snack at 3am

There is no competition here. No one gets a gold star. Contribution looks different for everyone — and that's the point.

Whether you're a helper, a dreamer, a mischief-maker, or someone who simply holds the energy of care in a space... you belong.

![Circle of diverse silhouettes holding hands together, celebrating belonging and inclusive community](/images/belonging-diversity.png)

## Who Belongs Here

This is a space for many.
But not for all.

Bottoms Up! welcomes queerness, neurodivergence, kink, softness, weirdness, and everything else that doesn't fit neatly into polite society. We hold space for shadow and play, for bodies that don't match expectations, for desires that don't ask permission.

We want you here if you come with curiosity.
We want you here if you long for honesty, connection, or the freedom to be as you are.
We want you here if you're ready to meet others with care, and to be met in return.

But let's be clear:

This is not a place for entitlement, for ego, or for domination without consent.
It's not a place for people who won't respect boundaries.
It's not a place for those unwilling to take responsibility for their impact.

If you're here to connect — for real — you're welcome.
If you're here to control, consume, or detach, you're not.

### Access Is Not the Same as Entitlement

We do our best to make this space financially and physically accessible.
**If money is the barrier, reach out.** We're ready to talk and find something that works.

Maybe that's a discount.
Maybe installments.
Maybe a trade.

We don't do shame. We do dialogue.

But access is a _shared responsibility_.
You still need to show up with presence. To tend to yourself and the people around you. To be ready for the intensity this space brings.

If you're not sure you're ready — that's okay.
Better to pause than to force it.

### The Intensity Is Real

This isn't a light weekend. It's immersive, emotional, and sensory. We support pacing and self-care: you're encouraged to be honest about what you can hold in community right now.

## The Flow of Our Days

**A rough outline. We'll adjust to what the camp needs.**

This isn't a scheduled program. It's a gentle container for what wants to emerge when people show up fully present, ready to connect, and willing to be real.

---

## Wednesday Afternoon – Build Begins

Come early if you can.
Not because we need help (though we do), but because this is one of the best ways to arrive.

There's something sacred about shaping the space before it holds us.
Hanging lights. Painting signs. Arranging the lounge areas.
Making coffee. Making eye contact. Making meaning.

No skills required. Just hands. Just heart. Just presence.

---

## Wednesday – We Land

Arrival day is shared. **Everyone is expected to arrive by Wednesday evening.** Settle in, let your body catch up, let the outside world fall away.

As night falls we move into Opening Circle — a threshold ritual rather than a lecture. We breathe together, ground in consent, and agree on the texture of the days ahead. From there, play begins softly and organically.

We ask you to begin with us. But you don't have to stay until the end.

Need the hour-by-hour? → [Schedule](/docs/practical/schedule)

If you find yourself overwhelmed, exhausted, complete — **it's okay to leave early**.  
We honor your limits. We celebrate your self-awareness.  
Tapping out is not failure. It's wisdom.

You know yourself best. We trust you.

---

## Thursday to Saturday – We Unfold

We begin Thursday morning with our **Consent Moment** —  
a guided, embodied check-in.  
Not just reminders, but rituals.  
It's mandatory. And it's meaningful.

From there, the days stretch open.

Jam spaces. Lounge whispers. Quiet rituals. Late-night laughter.
Rope in the space. Kisses in the dim light. Gentle movements. Soft eyes. Stillness. Play.

There will be peer-led offerings — nothing scheduled yet, everything possible.  
And we won't leave it all to chance.

---

## Sunday – We Unravel

For many, this is the soft close.
We gather our things. Tears come up.
We hold each other. We say goodbye.

But not everyone makes it to Sunday — and that's okay.

If you leave early, we'll miss you.
And we'll honor your choice.

Some people stay the whole time.
Some people leave halfway through.
Both are valid. Both are brave.

What matters is that you came at all.

---

## The Playground Is Wide

## Rope Is Just the Beginning

Yes, we love rope.  
But that's just the surface.

This is a space to play — with power, with surrender, with sensation, with self.  
It's a place where desire can stretch its legs. Where you can experiment, express, and explore without needing to perform.

Rope is our common language.  
But the dialects? Endless.

You don't need to be "good" at it.  
You don't need to know the names of the knots.  
You don't even need to tie.  
Curiosity is enough. Presence is enough. You are enough.

Come with an open body and a listening heart. That's all we ask.

### This is Not a Technical Skills Gathering

This is a living, breathing permission slip.

You'll find whips and wax, needles and nails, floggers and fire.  
You'll find the softest hands and the filthiest mouths.  
You'll find silence. You'll find sound.  
You'll find scenes that don't look like scenes at all — just two people, breathing together, holding a secret.

Nudity is welcome.  
Sexuality is not hidden.  
You don't have to dim your shine, your heat, your hunger.

This is a place where kink lives beside care.  
Where sex is sacred and messy and not up for anyone else's consumption.  
Where play can look like fucking — or crying — or lying in intimate embrace, wrapped in rope and connection, with someone watching over you.

# New Here? Welcome.

Maybe you've never been to a rope gathering before.  
Maybe you've never been naked in public.  
Maybe you've never shared intimate space with strangers.  
Maybe you've never said out loud that you're kinky.  
Maybe you're not even sure if you are.

You don't have to arrive confident. Or experienced. Or loud.  
You don't have to tie. You don't have to undress. You don't have to explain.  
You just have to be curious. And kind. And willing to feel.

## This is Not a Place for Experts

This is a place for the real.

We've built Bottoms Up! for the ones who want something more. Not flashier. Not sexier. But **truer**.

If you're worried you won't know how to start a conversation — you're not alone. Most of us have felt that. So we've created icebreakers, gentle encounters, and open spaces that make it easier to connect. No games, no pressure. Just invitations.

If you're afraid you'll be the only one who doesn't know how it all works — you won't be. We celebrate beginners. We honor questions. We welcome quiet.

**You belong here as you are.**

_Want to understand the deeper philosophy behind this approach?_ → [Core Philosophy](/docs/concept/philosophy)

</div>

### What if I don't want to do rope?

That's fine. Truly. Rope is the thread, not the whole fabric. Some people come just to feel the atmosphere. To connect. To flirt. To cry. To kiss. To watch. To rest.

Rope is welcome. Not required.

### What if I'm coming alone?

A lot of people do. We'll help you find your way in. Whether through shared meals, structured play spaces, or spontaneous moments in shared spaces, there are many ways to connect — slowly, gently, honestly.

You might leave with people you didn't know you needed.

### What if I feel overwhelmed?

We expect that. This experience can be intense. There are quiet places, kind volunteers, and soft hands if you need them. You can always step away, lie down, take a breath, cry, laugh, or ask for help.

Consent means you get to choose — every time.

---

## Who Is This For?

This isn't for everyone. That's not a judgment — it's design.

Bottoms Up! works best when people arrive knowing what they're stepping into. So let's get honest about who thrives here and who might find what they need elsewhere.

### Are You Craving This?

**✨ Deeper connection in your rope practice?**  
This isn't about learning more knots or perfecting technique. It's about finding the intimacy, presence, and emotional resonance that make rope feel sacred.

**🤝 Authentic community over surface performance?**  
We value real conversation over rope tricks. Vulnerability over Instagram moments. Being seen for who you are rather than what you can do.

**🕊️ Safety that goes beyond physical technique?**  
We create space for consent that's enthusiastic, ongoing, and held collectively. Emotional safety matters as much as physical safety here.

**🌅 Time to slow down and feel deeply?**  
Five days to step away from rush culture. To breathe. To be present. To let intimacy unfold naturally without agenda or timeline.

### You'll Love This If...

**You're craving connection over curriculum** — If you want a lineup of technical classes and certificates, this isn’t that. We learn here through play, presence, and community, not through a workshop schedule. Curious how that works over five days? → [Experience Structure](/docs/concept/experience)

**You're curious about rope** — whether you've never touched it or you've been tying for years. Experience level doesn't matter. Openness does.

**You value consent as an ongoing practice** — not just a checkbox, but a living dialogue that deepens intimacy and trust.

**You want to connect with like-minded people** — folks who see kink as a doorway to deeper humanity, not just a bedroom activity.

**You're comfortable with communal living** — shared meals, bunk beds, morning coffee conversations with people you just met.

**You can hold space for others' emotions** — tears, laughter, overwhelm, and joy are all welcome parts of this experience.

**You're ready to be fully present** — phones away, agendas aside, heart open to whatever wants to emerge.

### This Might Not Be Right If...

**You want a technical curriculum** — there’s no class schedule or certification path here.

**You prefer anonymity or a party vibe** — this space is intimate, communal, and people will remember you.

**Witnessing eros feels unsafe** — consented sexual expression happens in shared spaces, even if participation is never required. Read more about this in [Sex-Positive Space](/docs/concept/sex-positive).

For a clearer sense of who thrives here (and who doesn't), read [Who Belongs Here](/docs/concept/belonging). This page goes deeper into radical inclusivity alongside clear boundaries.

## Still Wondering?

Ask yourself:

💭 **Does this gathering feel like coming home to something I've been seeking?**

💭 **Am I ready to be vulnerable and hold space for others' vulnerability?**

💭 **Do I want to explore rope as a practice of intimacy and presence?**

💭 **Can I commit to five days of authentic engagement with a community?**

If you're feeling "YES" — even a nervous, excited, uncertain yes — then this might be exactly what you need.

_Ready to see what this looks like in practice?_ → [Experience Structure](/docs/concept/experience)

If you're feeling "maybe" or "I'm not sure" — that's perfectly valid too. Trust your instincts. There are many beautiful gatherings in the world. This one might not be yours right now, and that's okay.

---

You don't need to be ready. You just need to be here.

Come as you are. We'll meet you there.

## What We're Really After

Let's not pretend it's about rope alone.
Let's name what it really is: **a longing to be met**.

Most of us don't struggle with what we want. We struggle with how to begin. That first moment — the glance, the ask, the touch — can feel like the hardest one. So we build bridges. We create gentle rituals and open invitations that help people find their way to one another.

At Bottoms Up!, you won't leave with a certificate.
You might leave changed.

---

## Tie Like No One Is Watching

At Bottoms Up!, we cherish the ties that bind — not just bodies, but hearts and breath, shadow and light. "Tie like no one is watching" isn't a performance note. It's an invitation to drop the mask. To meet through rope, not just with hands, but with honesty.

---

## The Essence of Rope

Rope is a language. One of tension, stillness, surrender. It doesn't need applause. It doesn't need perfection. It needs presence.

Skill helps, sure. But the real magic lives in what can't be taught — those quiet, electric moments where something shifts between you.

Without eros, rope is just knots. With it, it becomes a ritual of longing and play and truth.

---

## Beyond the Workshop Mindset

It's tempting to chase knowledge. To fill a schedule, collect techniques, feel productive. But we've seen it: the hunger isn't really for more information. It's for connection. For experiences that linger.

The kind that don't come from sitting in a circle taking notes — they come from being brave enough to reach out.

**This isn't about downloading information.**
**It's about transformation.**

We don't chase productivity. We don't sell certainty. What we're building is a community of risk-takers and tenderness-makers. People who want to feel more, not just know more.

---

## Designed for Serendipity

We design for encounters that might not happen unless we make space for them. This isn't a lineup of scheduled classes. It's a curated field of possibilities — moments of shared joy, awkward first hellos, spontaneous knots that turn into friendships.

The setting changes everything. You feel it when the atmosphere envelops your scene. When you move with intention in shared space. When rope becomes the bridge between souls in this carefully held container.

Here, we let go of the studio rules. We create suspension from within. The space becomes part of the play — intimate, alive, and endlessly welcoming.

---

## Embracing Eros and Inclusivity

We don't shy away from desire. We invite it.

Bottoms Up! is a sex-positive space: sexuality is neither hidden nor required, and eros sits alongside rope, intimacy, and care. Bodies, hunger, and reverence all belong here.

This is a space for all bodies, all backgrounds, all orientations. We honor the rigger and the bottom equally — not as roles to perform, but as people to witness.

Rope isn't a hierarchy. It's a dance of trust, in whatever form it takes.

_Wondering who belongs here?_ → [Who Belongs Here](/docs/concept/belonging)

Come if you're ready for something real.
Come if you're craving something deeply connective.
Come if you want to feel rope not just on your skin — but in your soul.

## Post-Rope: A Gentle Rebellion

**Post-Rope** isn't a style, or a brand, or a club.  
It's a feeling — a quiet turning away from the noise.  
A refusal of the performance economy.

We've grown tired of rope as content. Of stages. Of proving.  
We want rope that's messy, tender, human again.

### Beyond the Performance

We've all seen it:  
Who's desirable. Who's collecting glances. Who's in the cool crowd.

It's just heteronormativity replaying itself in rope — high school hierarchies nobody really enjoyed the first time.

When the game is about catching eyes or proving worth, curiosity dies. Vulnerability hides. Encounters shrink to performance.

### Breaking the Script

The moment we step outside that pattern, everything changes.  
People stop impressing. They start meeting.  
They risk awkwardness instead of polish.  
They reach for intimacy instead of recognition.

That's when rope gets real again — not as spectacle, but as bridge.

**Post-Rope looks like this:**

- The kitchen tie that becomes a midnight heart-talk
- The messy session that ends in laughter
- The hug that means more than the knots
- The silence where nothing "happens" but everything shifts

### Against the Algorithm

In Post-Rope, we gently rebel against the scroll.

We're tired of:

- Rope flattened into content
- Intimacy cut into reels
- Quiet moments mined for clout
- The pressure to _be seen_ rather than _be_

Here, no one ties for likes.
No followers. No brands. No filters. Just people.
Alive. Breathing. Together.

It expands on themes introduced in [Core Philosophy](/docs/concept/philosophy) and explains how sexuality shows up in [Experience Structure](/docs/concept/experience). Read this if you need clarity on our stance toward desire and eros._

</div>

---

## We Are One of the Very Few

Most rope events sanitize sexuality. They keep eros at arm's length, treat desire as a side effect rather than the point, frame sexual expression as something to manage rather than celebrate.

Bottoms Up! is not most events.

We are **explicitly, unapologetically sex-positive**. And that's rare in the shibari world.

---

## What Sex-Positive Means (For Us)

**Not:** Porn-centric performance, exploitation, male-gaze spectacle, pressure to be sexual, crude or fetishy stereotypes.

**Yes:** Desire is sacred. Sexuality is part of our humanity. Eros belongs alongside rope, intimacy, and presence. People can express their sexuality—or choose not to—without apology.

Sex-positive means:

- Desire is normal, worthy, and beautiful
- Sexuality is diverse (some people want sex; some want intimacy; some want neither; all valid)
- Consent makes it ethical
- Mystery and sensuality matter more than explicitness
- We don't separate the body from the spirit

---

## Why It Matters

Most rope communities are built by and for people who had to hide their sexuality to stay safe. Rope was refuge—a place where desire could exist, but quietly. Gratefully. Apologetically.

We've inherited that caution.

But something shifts when we stop apologizing for desire. When we say openly: **Yes, sexuality is part of what we practice here. Yes, people will kiss, touch, make love, express pleasure. Yes, nudity happens. Yes, we light candles and we also light fire.**

That shift creates permission. Room. Freedom.

If you've been told your desire is too much, too weird, too kinky, too queer, too anything—this space says: **Not here. Here, your hunger is welcome.**

---

## How Sexuality Shows Up

**At the gathering, you might see:**

- People kissing during rope scenes
- Sensual touching that's sexual or sacred (sometimes both)
- Naked bodies being bound, touched, witnessed
- Scenes that are foreplay, lovemaking, or something with no name
- Pleasure. Sounds of pleasure.
- Intimacy that's tender, fierce, slow, urgent, playful, solemn

**You won't see:**

- Pressure to perform
- Objectification
- Spectacle for its own sake
- Exploitation

**You will feel:**

- Presence
- Consent
- Reverence for bodies and desire
- The sacred in the sensual

---

## The Distinction We Make

We're **not** a sex party. We're not a porn set. We're not a place where sexuality is the entertainment for voyeurs.

We're a space where people can explore sexuality **with dignity, presence, and care**. Where desire is woven into rope, into ritual, into connection.

Sex can be:

- A spiritual practice
- An expression of power and vulnerability
- A form of intimacy
- A way to be fully alive in your body
- Joyful, tender, intense, playful, sacred

All of this is welcome. And so is NOT participating. Your sexuality is yours—to express, to explore, or to keep private.

---

## Permission You Might Need

If you've been told:

**"You're too sexual for rope"** — You're not. Your desire is part of what makes rope alive.

**"That's not what shibari is supposed to be"** — This is what it can be when we stop gatekeeping.

**"Nice people don't talk about sex"** — We're not nice. We're real. Real includes desire.

**"I'm not brave enough to want this"** — Bravery isn't required. Just curiosity. Just honesty.

**"I'll be judged for my sexuality"** — Not here. We celebrate the full spectrum—from asexual to hypersexual and everything in between.

---

## Why This Matters for Rope

Rope is a language of vulnerability and power. Sexuality is where vulnerability gets most real, power most potent, truth most naked.

When we bind someone, we're asking: _Can you trust me with your body? With your desire? With your truth?_

That trust is erotic. It's also sacred. Both things at once.

Trying to do rope without acknowledging sexuality is like trying to do rope while pretending bodies don't exist. You're hiding the most important part.

We don't hide. We celebrate.

---

## What This Means for You

You can:

- Bring your full sexuality
- Express desire without apology
- Explore pleasure with a partner
- Watch others without judgment
- Sit quietly with your own desire
- Choose not to participate sexually
- Change your mind mid-gathering
- Have sex, or not have sex, or something else entirely

**You cannot:**

- Violate someone's consent
- Pressure anyone into sexuality
- Detach from presence (sex as performance is not welcome)
- Treat bodies as objects

---

## We're Building Something Different

Most rope communities exist in the margins, grateful for the space, not pushing back against the culture that says desire should be hidden.

We're building something different: a community where sexuality is named, honored, celebrated. Where you don't have to choose between being kinky and being respectable. Where desire and reverence live in the same moment.

This is rare.

That's why you're here.

---

## Come If...

- You want to explore sexuality in community, safely, with consent
- You're ready to witness others' desire without judgment
- You're curious about what rope becomes when we stop apologizing for eros
- You want permission to bring your whole self—including your sexuality
- You're hungry for a space that celebrates bodies, pleasure, and power

**Come as you are. Desire and all.**

### Dress Code: Urban Mystics & Enchanted Souls

This year, we invite you to **step into the space** and emerge as your truest, most authentic self — a being of intimate connection, of soft lights and shared stories.

Our theme: **Urban Mystics & Enchanted Souls**.

Picture it: sophisticated mystics with velvet robes, enchanting souls with flowing fabrics, artistic spirits with creative accessories, intuitive healers with meaningful symbols. A gathering of beings who connect deeply — and never needed to pretend.

Let your attire reflect the person within — or the one you long to become.

---

### Archetypes to Inspire

**Urban Mystics**: Sophisticated and enigmatic. Velvet robes, crystal accessories, intricate jewelry, mysterious pendants. Maybe a tarot-inspired accessory or a single meaningful symbol.

**Enchanted Souls**: Light, ethereal, and a little mysterious. Flowing fabrics, delicate accessories, glowing threads. Are you a night-soul or twilight-soul?

**Creative Spirits**: Artistic, expressive, eclectic. Mixed patterns, unique accessories, personal treasures — vintage buttons, creative patches, meaningful trinkets. Nothing matches. Everything tells a story.

**Intuitive Healers**: Wise, nurturing, transformative. Soft cloaks, healing crystals, symbolic jewelry. Maybe a meaningful pendant or a small book of inspiration. You're here for connection.

**Night Poets**: Elegant or passionate. Silk scarves, artistic jewelry, flowing layers, comfortable yet expressive. Choose romance, creativity, or both.

**Shape-Shifters**: Mix everything. Different fabrics and textures. Layers that express your mood. Let your look evolve over time. Let no one define you.

---

**Dress for ease, for touch, for breath.**

---

### Comfort is Sacred

How much (or how little) you dress up is your call.
The space welcomes everyone — whether you're in elegant attire, comfortable loungewear, or creative expression.

We don't enforce this theme. It's an invitation, not a requirement.

And if you want to come as a purple hippo in a tutu? That's wonderfully expressive for us.

We can't wait to see who — or what — joins us.

## Sleeping Close

Nights shape us as much as days.
The way we rest, the way we hear each other breathing, the way we wake up into shared light — it all weaves into the story of this gathering.

This isn't about luxury.
It's about proximity. About choosing to be held by a space, and by each other.

### What You'll Find

**🏠 Indoor Accommodations:**

- **Bunk beds indoors** — no tents, no weather worries. Each person gets their own bed and mattress. Bring the bedding that makes you feel safe and soft.
- **Real facilities** — hot showers, indoor toilets, places to brush your teeth, splash water on your face, and return renewed.

**🛏️ Room Options:**

- **Mixed rooms** — for those who like variety
- **FLINTA-only rooms** — for women (including trans women), lesbians, intersex, non-binary, trans, and agender folks. Self-defined; no gatekeeping.

_Self-defined: choose this if you identify with any part of FLINTA. We don’t police identity; pick what helps you rest._

- **"Snoring sanctuary"** — for heavy sleepers and their companions

It's simple. But it's real.

### The Atmosphere

Don't expect hotel silence. Expect life.
Whispers between bunks at midnight. Someone brewing tea in the morning for whoever's awake. A soft shuffle of blankets. Occasional laughter, occasional tears.

This is what communal rest feels like. A little messy. Deeply human. Intimate in the most ordinary ways.

Some nights you'll fall asleep faster than you thought. Some nights you'll lie awake, listening to breath, and feel strangely grateful you're not alone.

## Before You Arrive

Take a breath. You're about to cross a threshold.

Maybe you're nervous. Maybe you're excited. Maybe both at once.
That's exactly right. This is a big moment — you're choosing vulnerability, connection, presence.

**You belong here.**

This page will walk you through what happens when you arrive, where to go, who you'll meet, and how the first 24 hours unfold. We've got you.

---

## Wednesday Afternoon: Build Day (Optional, Recommended)

**Arrival window:** Anytime from 14:00 onwards

If you can come early, **please do.** Build Day is one of the most beautiful ways to arrive.

There's something intimate about shaping the space together before it holds us. Hanging fairy lights. Arranging cushions. Setting up play areas. Making coffee. Making eye contact. Making meaning.

**You don't need skills. You don't need to know what you're doing.**
Someone will hand you a task. You'll work alongside strangers who won't be strangers for long.

By the time Opening Circle begins, you'll already have your first inside jokes, your first shared glances, your first sense of *oh, these are my people.*

### What to Do When You Arrive for Build Day

1. **Park and find the main entrance** — Look for welcome signs
2. **Check in at the registration table** — We'll have a list with your name
3. **Get your welcome pack** — Includes your room assignment, schedule, and name tag
4. **Drop your bags in your room** — Find your bunk, claim your space
5. **Come back to the common area** — Someone will guide you to whatever needs doing

No pressure. No performance. Just presence.

---

## Wednesday Evening: Main Arrival

**Arrival deadline:** 21:00 (for Opening Circle)

Most people arrive Wednesday evening between 18:00–20:30. You'll see cars pulling in, people hauling bags, nervous laughter, tentative hellos.

### The Check-In Process

**Step 1: Find Registration (18:00–20:30)**

Look for the registration table near the main entrance. You'll see:
- A table with a sign that says "Welcome" or "Check-In"
- One or two friendly faces with clipboards
- Other arrivals milling about, looking as nervous as you feel

**Step 2: Check In**

Tell us your name. We'll:
- Check you off the list
- Give you a **welcome pack** (room assignment, schedule, venue map, name tag)
- Answer any immediate questions ("Where's the bathroom?" "Which room am I in?")
- Point you toward your accommodations

**Step 3: Settle Into Your Room**

Find your room number (on your welcome pack). You'll be in a shared bunk room with 4–8 other people.

- Claim a bunk (first-come, first-served)
- Unpack what you need for the night
- Meet your roommates (or not — some people need quiet time first)
- Change into comfortable clothes if you want

**Step 4: Explore (If You Have Time)**

Before Opening Circle begins at 21:00, wander a little:
- Find the bathrooms
- Locate the kitchen/common area
- Peek into the play spaces (they'll be empty, waiting)
- Breathe. Let your nervous system catch up.

You don't have to talk to anyone yet if you're not ready.
Just let the space start to feel familiar.

## Understanding the Space

### Venue Layout (Quick Orientation)

We'll provide a printed map in your welcome pack, but here's the general layout:

**Main Building:**
- Common room / lounge area (socializing, meals, gathering)
- Kitchen (self-serve snacks, coffee, tea)
- Shared bathrooms and showers
- Some bunk rooms

**Outbuildings/Other Spaces:**
- Additional bunk rooms
- Play spaces (rope jam areas, private rooms)
- Quiet room (for overwhelm, rest, crying, being alone)
- Outdoor fire pit area

**Important Locations to Know:**
- **Quiet room** — Door will be marked; go here if you need to decompress
- **First aid station** — Someone will point this out at Opening Circle
- **Consent Crew area** — We'll introduce them at Opening Circle

### Where Things Are

- **Coffee/tea:** Always available in the kitchen
- **Water:** Refill stations throughout the space
- **Snacks:** Kitchen has basics; bring your own favorites too
- **Bathrooms:** Gender-neutral; marked clearly
- **Towels:** Bring your own
- **Charging stations:** Available in common areas (bring your own cable)

---

## Who's Who: Finding Support & Connection

One of the most common questions: **"Who do I talk to if I need help?"**

Here's how to identify key people:

### FWBs (Friends With Bracelets)

Anyone wearing a **colored bracelet** is a **Friend With Bracelet (FWB).**

This means they're open to:
- Holding space for a check-in
- Listening without fixing
- Helping you find resources
- Offering a grounding presence

**You can become an FWB too.** Bracelets will be available throughout the event. When you feel resourced enough to care for others, put one on.

**How to approach an FWB:**
- "Hey, I see you're wearing a bracelet. Do you have a minute?"
- "I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — could we sit for a moment?"
- "I'm new and not sure how to [ask someone to play / find the quiet room / etc.] — can you help?"

### Consent Crew

Consent Crew members will be introduced at **Opening Circle.** They're here for:
- Boundary violations or consent concerns
- Conflict mediation
- Safety issues
- Situations that feel off or unsafe

**How to identify them:** They'll wear specific identifying markers (we'll explain at Opening Circle).

**How to reach them:**
- Find them in person (ask anyone if you're not sure who they are)
- Email: consent-crew@roguerope.be
- Emergency contact (shared at Opening Circle)

### Organizers

The folks who built this space. We'll introduce ourselves at Opening Circle.

**We're here for:**
- Logistics questions (food, accommodations, schedules)
- Venue issues (heating, access, supplies)
- General "I don't know who to ask" questions

You'll see us moving through the space, checking in, making coffee, adjusting things.

### Everyone Else

Most people here are just like you — nervous, excited, figuring it out.

Some have been before. Some haven't.
Some are confident. Some are quiet.
All of them are here because they chose connection over comfort.

**You can talk to anyone.** More on that below.

---

## Opening Circle (Wednesday 21:00) — Mandatory

This is the threshold ritual. **Everyone must be present.**

### What Is It?

Opening Circle is our collective landing. It's where we:
- Breathe together for the first time
- Ground in consent and shared agreements
- Meet each other's eyes
- Set the container for the days ahead

**It's not a lecture. It's a ritual.**

### What Happens

- We'll gather in a circle (literally)
- Facilitators will guide us through:
  - A grounding practice (breathing, feeling our bodies, arriving)
  - Introduction to key people (organizers, Consent Crew)
  - Consent agreements (enthusiastic, ongoing, collective)
  - Practical info (where things are, daily rhythm, how to ask for help)
  - Community agreements (how we care for each other)
- We'll share brief introductions (just your name, no need for a speech)
- We'll set an intention together

**How long:** ~60–90 minutes

**What to bring:** Just yourself. Wear something comfortable. Sit on the floor or grab a cushion.

### After Opening Circle

When the circle closes, the gathering truly begins.

Some people will drift to the play spaces. Some will stay in the lounge and talk. Some will make tea and sit quietly. Some will go to bed early, overwhelmed and needing rest.

**All of it is okay.**

There's no "right" way to start. Follow what feels true.

---

## Your First Conversations

**"How do I even start talking to people?"**

We hear you. This is one of the hardest parts.

### You Don't Have to Be Interesting

You don't need a clever opening line. You don't need to perform.

Here are some honest, easy ways to start:

**Simple openers:**
- "Is this your first time here?"
- "How are you feeling so far?"
- "I'm [name]. I have no idea what I'm doing." (People love honesty.)
- "Do you know where the [coffee / quiet room / bathroom] is?" (Even if you do.)
- "Can I sit here?" (Then just sit. Sometimes presence is enough.)

**If you're nervous, say so:**
- "I'm feeling a bit shy — is it okay if I just sit with you quietly?"
- "I'm working up the courage to talk to people. You're my first attempt."

Vulnerability is currency here. Use it.

### If You're Coming Solo

You're not alone — about 30% of attendees come solo.

**Ways to connect:**
- Come to Build Day (easiest way to make early connections)
- Sit in the common area with a cup of tea (people will find you)
- Ask someone at dinner if you can join them
- Offer to help with something (dishes, tidying, setting up)
- Attend the Consent Moment on Thursday morning (everyone will be there)

**You will find your people.** It might not happen in the first hour. That's okay.

By day 2, you'll have inside jokes. By day 4, you'll have people who feel like family.

### If You're Coming With a Partner

You might be tempted to stay close to them. That's natural.

But also: **let yourself wander.**

Part of the magic here is meeting people outside your usual orbit. Your partner will still be there. And you'll have more to share when you reconvene.

Talk beforehand about:
- How much time you want together vs. apart
- Whether you'll check in at meals or just find each other organically
- What kind of connection (flirting, play, etc.) feels okay with others

Jealousy might come up. That's normal. More on that in [Partners](/docs/wellbeing/partners).

---

## The First Night

### After Opening Circle: What Now?

**Option 1: Stay up and explore**
- Hang out in the lounge
- Wander into a play space and watch (or ask to play)
- Make new friends over tea
- Flirt. Connect. Be soft.

**Option 2: Go to bed early**
- You've traveled. You're tired. Your nervous system is processing.
- Sleep is sacred. No one will judge you for resting.

**Option 3: Find a quiet corner**
- Process alone for a bit
- Journal, breathe, cry if you need to
- Come back to the group when you're ready

All of these are valid. Honor what you need.

### Sleep Logistics

**Shared rooms:**
- Bunk beds (bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper)
- People will come and go at different hours
- Some folks stay up late; some wake early
- Respect quiet hours as best you can

**If you can't sleep:**
- Wander to the common area (there's always someone awake)
- Make tea
- Sit by the fire
- Read, write, be

**If you're overwhelmed:**
- Find the quiet room
- Find an FWB (someone with a bracelet)
- Step outside for air
- It's okay to feel a lot. This space can hold it.

---

## Thursday Morning: Your First Full Day

### Consent Moment (Mandatory, ~10:00)

Every morning starts with a **Consent Moment** — a brief, embodied check-in.

**It's not a lecture. It's a ritual.**

We gather, we ground, we remember: consent is ongoing, enthusiastic, collective.

**What happens:**
- Brief grounding practice (5–10 minutes)
- Consent reminders and reflections
- Space for questions or concerns
- Community check-in

**Then the day opens wide.**

### What to Do With Your Day

There's no schedule. No classes. No curriculum.

**Your options:**
- Jam spaces (open areas for rope play)
- Lounge and talk
- Rest, read, journal
- Offer to lead something (a workshop, a ritual, a walk)
- Flirt, connect, explore
- Just *be*

For the full rhythm of the days, see [Experience Structure](/docs/concept/experience) and [Schedule](/docs/practical/schedule).

---

## Common First-Day Feelings

### "I don't know anyone."
**You will.** Give it time. By tonight, you'll recognize faces. By tomorrow, you'll have friends.

### "Everyone else seems to know what they're doing."
**They don't.** Most people are figuring it out as they go. Even the ones who've been here before.

### "I feel shy / awkward / out of place."
**You're not alone.** Half the room feels this way. The ones who look confident? They're probably faking it too.

### "I'm overwhelmed."
**That's okay.** Find the quiet room. Find an FWB. Take a break. You don't have to do everything.

### "I want to play but don't know how to ask."
**Start small.** "I'd love to tie with you sometime this week — would you be open to that?"
Or: "I'm new to this. Could we do something simple together?"

People will meet you where you are.

---

## You've Got This

Arrival is the hardest part.

Once you're here, once you've crossed the threshold, once you've said your name in Opening Circle — the rest will unfold.

You don't have to know what you're doing.
You don't have to be ready.
You just have to be here.

And you are.

Welcome home.

---

## Quick Reference

**Lost or confused?** Ask anyone. Seriously.

**Need support?** Find an FWB (colored bracelet) or Consent Crew member.

**Feeling overwhelmed?** Quiet room is always available.

**Want to connect but don't know how?** Sit in the common area with tea. People will find you.

**First night jitters?** Totally normal. It gets easier.

## The Gathering

**Is this just 5 days?** Yes. Wed 18:00 – Sun 16:00. That's 5 full days—long enough to truly settle in, short enough to stay fully present.

**What time do I need to arrive?** **Wednesday by 21:00 for the Opening Circle — this is mandatory.** You must be present for this foundational ritual. If you can't make Wednesday evening, this gathering isn't the right fit for you this year. Leaving early is fine, but arriving on time is essential. → Travel tips & Build Day details live in [Getting There](getting-there).

**Do I have to do rope?** No. Watch, connect, rest, or play. All of it's welcome.

**Is this sexual?** Yes. Sex-positive, sexual interactions happen. If seeing others kiss, touch, or express sexuality makes you very uncomfortable, this isn't your event. We're clear because consent is mutual.

**Will I know anyone?** ~30% come solo. You'll meet people. By day 2, you'll know folks. By day 4, you're part of something.

---

## Practical Details

**What's included?** €169 covers: 4 nights, one hot meal per day plus provisions, spaces, support, basic equipment. → Need the full breakdown? See [Participation Details](participation).

**Sliding scale?** Yes. Email [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) with "Financial access" — we offer discounts, payment plans, work exchange, no shame.

**How many people?** 42 max. Why? Intimacy without anonymity. We know each other's names.

**Who comes?** Mix of rope experience, queer, kinky, disabled, neurodivergent folks from across Europe. Beginners and experienced. Solo, couples, friend groups.

**Accessibility/disabilities?** Tell us when you register. We offer indoor rooms, ground-floor options, quiet spaces, flexible meals, volunteer support. Have specific needs? Email us early—we'll problem-solve. → For room layouts and vibes, see [Accommodations](accommodations).

**Food allergies?** Vegetarian/meat fully supported. Vegan best-effort. Special needs (gluten-free, etc.)? Tell us; we coordinate. → Menu rhythm and kitchen info live in [Food & Meals](food).

**What rope to bring?** 4x8m natural fiber (jute/hemp/cotton), scissors, a partner. Optional: your favorite rope/toys. → Full packing list in [Things to Bring](things-to-bring).

**Dress code?** No. Wear comfortable, intentional clothes. Layers. Something for the play party. Slippers for shared floors.

---

## Safety & Boundaries

**Consent framework?** Ask before touch. Respect "no." Check in during play. Continuous, not one-time. [Full framework →]

**Consent violation?** Find Consent Crew (identified at opening circle). You're supported first. We take it seriously. You're believed.

**First aid?** Yes, trained responders on-site. Hospital in Mol (~10 min).

**Overwhelmed?** Quiet spaces available. Find an FWB (support person). Rest, cry, leave if needed. Your wellbeing comes first.

---

## Before & After

**How to prepare?** Read [Getting Started](/docs/concept/is-this-for-you) and [Philosophy](/docs/concept/philosophy). Reflect on why you're coming. Talk to your partner if you have one. Arrive open.

**Subdrop?** Emotional low after intensity. Rest, hydrate, move your body, reach out. It passes. See [After the Gathering](/docs/wellbeing/after-integration) for more support.

**Stay connected?** Join our WhatsApp community, attend monthly calls, sign up for the mailing list. See [After the Gathering](/docs/wellbeing/after-integration) for details.

## Build Day - Wednesday Afternoon

### Arrival flows into build.

Bottoms Up! doesn't just _appear_.
It's built — by hands, by hearts, by you.

Our gathering now begins on **Wednesday afternoon**, with **Build Day** folded into the experience itself. No separation. No staff. Just a space, some rope, and a growing circle of people making it real.

This is your invitation to be part of the beginning.

### What to Expect

You don't need to be strong. Or skilled. Or organized.  
You just need to show up.

We'll hang lights, set up suspension points, decorate the space, arrange the chill spaces, maybe even rig a secret nook or two. Some will hammer. Some will sweep. Some will make tea and tell stories. All of it counts.

Come early. Arrive Wednesday afternoon if you can.
This is one of the best ways to meet people, soften into the vibe, and become part of the magic _before_ it officially begins.

### Wednesday 21:00 is Mandatory

**You must arrive by Wednesday 21:00 for the Opening Circle.** This is not flexible.

This ritual is the threshold—it shapes how we hold space together, sets our collective agreements, and creates the energetic foundation for everything that follows.

If you cannot commit to being present Wednesday evening, this gathering isn't the right fit for you this year. We'd rather you honor your real capacity and join us when you can fully show up.

**No late arrivals.** Plan accordingly.

---

## Nearby Accommodations (If You Need Them)

### Hotels & Accommodations

If you're arriving from far away and want to rest before Wednesday, search "hotels in Mol, Belgium" or nearby towns for Tuesday night stays. This gives you time to settle before heading to the venue for the Wednesday 21:00 Opening Circle.

### Airbnb/Vacation Rentals

Search Mol on Airbnb if you're traveling from far away and want to rest before Wednesday. You can stay nearby Tuesday night or early Wednesday, then arrive at the venue for the Opening Circle at 21:00.

---

Come Wednesday if you can. Build the space with us. Let's create something beautiful together.

## The Basic Idea

Care for shared space is collective. Notice what's yours. Pick it up. Clean what you use. Respect what others have left.

---

## During the Event

We share these rooms like we share scenes: with care, attention, and a sense that someone else will arrive after us. Notice what needs doing and do it if you can.

**Meal areas** stay inviting when we clear plates, wipe tables, and tuck leftovers away before they wander off on their own. If you see dishes waiting for a wash, give them a quick rinse or run them to the dish station.

**Play spaces** breathe easier when equipment gets a wipe-down, ropes are coiled, and furniture finds its home again. Think of it as resetting the stage for whoever comes next.

**Sleeping areas** feel restful when bunks stay loosely organized, clothes live in bags instead of on floors, and shared items boomerang back to where everyone expects them.

**Bathrooms** move faster when showers stay short, surfaces get a quick swoosh, and anything disposable lands in the bins provided (menstrual products included).

**General vibe:** carry your trash with you, flip lights off if you’re the last one out, and if something looks off, either tend to it or tap an organizer. Shared responsibility is the kink here.

---

## Final Day Checkout

- Strip your bed
- Collect all your belongings
- Clean your bunk area
- Return room key
- Leave nothing behind except gratitude

---

## After You Leave

If you plan to share photos or memories beyond our private channels, read the “After the Gathering” section of [Photography Guidelines]({{< ref "/docs/practical/photography-guidelines" >}} "Photography Guidelines") for consent refreshers, venue anonymity, and deletion requests. Protect the people and the place the same way you did on site.

---

## Why It Matters

When we leave space better than we found it, we:

- Show respect for the venue
- Demonstrate consent (even to the building)
- Practice caring—which is what this gathering is about
- Make the next gathering possible

**It becomes a practice you carry into your life.**

## Getting Your Ticket: Saying Yes (When You Mean It)

A ticket isn't just entry — it's commitment.
To show up. To co-create. To meet this intensity with presence.

Securing your spot at Bottoms Up! is simple — but we ask that you move slowly. This isn't just about clicking "buy." It's about saying yes, with your whole self.

---

## Before You Commit: Reflect First

If you've made it to this page, you've probably explored the rest of the site. (If not, we lovingly encourage you to pause and wander back through the other pages.)

This isn't a spectator gathering. It's immersive. Real. Sometimes beautifully raw.
We want you to arrive with your eyes wide open — excited, ready, and fully informed about what you're stepping into.

---

### Ask Yourself First

Before you grab a ticket, take a breath. Ask yourself:

- Does this call to where I'm at right now?
- Will it nourish me — or stretch me too thin?
- Do I have the capacity (emotionally, physically, financially) to be fully present?

**FOMO is not a good reason to come.**
You deserve more than that. And so does this space. This gathering asks for your full presence — not your anxious attendance.

Come because it's a yes in your gut.
Not a maybe in your mind.

---

### Can't Afford It Right Now?

If money is the only thing standing between you and this experience, please reach out.
We're open to real conversation — and committed to finding a solution that honors both your needs and ours.

That might mean a sliding scale, a payment plan, work exchange, or creative alternatives.
No shame. No complicated applications. Just honest conversation and mutual care.

**Email us at [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be)** and let us know what's manageable.
We'll meet you where we can.

### Beyond Your Ticket: A Wearable Memory

Gathering with us? Consider taking home a thoughtfully designed t-shirt — a soft, high-quality keepsake that celebrates what you've shared. Each shirt is €25.

**Pre-order before the gathering** to guarantee your size and have it waiting at check-in. Or **order online after the event** if you want to think about it first. We'll handle shipping to you — no need to carry it home with you.

---

## Life Happens: Cancellations, Refunds & Changes

We understand life happens. Plans change. Circumstances shift. We're not here to punish you for that.

**That said,** once you register, we commit resources — food, accommodations, supplies are ordered. Our policy balances your needs with our real costs.

---

## Cancellation & Refund Policy

### The Clear Rule: Up to 3 Weeks Before = Full Refund

**Cancellation window:** Up to 3 weeks before the event (by January 25, 2026)

**Refund:** 100% refund via our ticket vending system

**How to cancel:**

1. Log into your ticket vending account
2. Request cancellation/refund
3. Refund processes within 7 days to your original payment method

**Why this works:** This gives us time to sell your spot to someone on the waitlist, adjust food orders, and reallocate accommodations.

---

### After 3 Weeks: No Refunds

**Cancellation window:** Less than 3 weeks before the event (after January 25, 2026)

**Refund:** No refund

**Why:** We've already purchased food, locked in accommodations, and confirmed our supply chain. Your payment covers costs we've already incurred.

**BUT:** You have options available (see Ticket Transfers & Resale section below).

---

### Partial Attendance

#### What If I Can Only Come 2–3 Days?

**You still pay full price** (€169).

**Why:** Food, accommodations, and support are bundled. We can't break them apart.

**But you can:**

- Leave early (Friday instead of Sunday): Totally fine; meals adjust but price stays same

**Important:** You must arrive by Wednesday 21:00 for the Opening Circle. If you cannot commit to this, this gathering may not be right for you.

**Better option:** If you need partial attendance, **reach out before registering.** Maybe we can work something out. But expect to pay full price.

---

### No-Show Policy

#### If You Don't Show Up

**Without notice:**

- You forfeit your ticket (no refund)
- We keep your payment
- Your spot can't be reallocated

**With late notice:**

- See refund timeline above

**In emergency (hospitalized, accident, etc.):**

- **Contact us ASAP** when you're able
- We'll assess your situation
- Possible deferral or resale facilitation (depending on circumstances)

---

## Ticket Transfers & Resale

### Your Options If You Can't Attend

#### Option 1: Resell Your Ticket (Recommended)

**You can resell your ticket to someone else.** This way, your money doesn't disappear — it goes to the new buyer.

**How it works:**

1. **Find a buyer** (friend, community group, WhatsApp community, etc.)
2. **Email us** at [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) with:
   - Your name and order number
   - Their name and email
   - Subject: "Ticket transfer request"
3. **We vet the buyer** (quick check — ensuring they understand the event and values)
4. **Once approved,** the transfer is complete in our system
5. **The buyer pays you directly** (we don't handle the money transfer)

**Why we vet:** We want to protect the community and ensure people arrive with aligned expectations.

**Cost to you:** Free. No processing fee. The buyer reimburses you directly.

---

#### Option 2: Wait List Facilitation (If We're Fully Booked)

**If we've sold all 42 tickets and have a waitlist:**

We can add your cancellation to the waitlist pool, and refund the first person who can attend.

**This only works if:**

- We're fully booked (42/42 tickets sold)
- There's an active waitlist

**This doesn't work if:**

- We're not fully booked (your refund just reduces event revenue)
- Your cancellation is within 2 weeks (not enough time to notify waitlist)

---

### Step-by-Step Transfer Process

**You can transfer your ticket to another person.**

**How:**

1. **You find the buyer** (friend, community member, etc.)
2. **Email [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be)** with:
   - Subject: "Ticket transfer request"
   - Your name and order number
   - New buyer's name and email
   - Brief note (optional): who they are, how you know them
3. **We vet the transfer** (confirm they understand the event)
4. **Transfer approved:** Buyer's info replaces yours in the system
5. **Buyer makes payment to you** (outside our system)

**Vetting process:**

- We check they understand the event is consent-focused, intimate, and community-based
- We ask 1-2 questions to ensure alignment
- Takes 2-3 days
- If approved, we send confirmation to both of you

**This works any time** (even the week before), as long as we have time to update our records.

---

### Resale Rules

- **You set the price** (we don't control it; that's between you and buyer)
- **You handle payment** (we don't facilitate money transfer)
- **We vet the buyer** (just to protect the community)
- **No processing fee** from us
- **Contact us first** before selling (so we can coordinate vetting)

---

## Questions?

**About the cancellation policy?** Email [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be)

**About resale or deferral?** Let us know in your email.

**Emergency situation?** Reach out — we're here to listen and work with you.

**Not sure if you should register?** Let's talk first. Better to be clear before committing than to cancel later.

## Why This Exists

People come to Bottoms Up! to be real — soft, ecstatic, messy, reverent. That kind of openness only happens when we know the room is safe. Cameras are welcome **only** when they honor that trust.

---

## Core Rule: Explicit Consent, Every Time

- Ask **before** you take a photo or video  
- Ask **everyone** in the frame — foreground, background, even blurry shapes  
- State how you intend to use it (personal memento? private album? might share later?)  
- Accept "no" immediately and without persuasion  
- Be ready to delete in the moment if someone changes their mind

_Blur is not consent. Assumption is not consent._

---

## How to Ask Without Disrupting

- Approach people when they’re not in the middle of a scene  
- Keep it simple: “Can I capture this for my personal memory?”  
- If it’s a group shot, get a verbal yes from **every** person  
- If anyone hesitates, treat it as a no  
- Put the camera away during sensitive rituals and consent moments

---

## What’s Not Allowed

- Bystander shots, candids of people you didn’t ask  
- Flash, loud shutters, or anything that breaks the scene  
- Filming scenes you’re not directly part of  
- Recording audio without explicit consent  
- Using cameras in bathrooms, changing areas, or private rooms

If you’re unsure whether something is okay, skip it or check with an organizer.

---

## Respect the Space

The venue is part of our privacy. When framing photos:

- Avoid wide shots that reveal location details, signage, or maps  
- Crop or blur identifying features if in doubt  
- Never capture staff or community members who haven’t opted in

---

## After the Gathering

- Re-confirm with every person in the image before you share it anywhere  
- Keep the venue anonymous: no names, addresses, or identifiable architecture  
- Remove posts immediately if anyone asks you to delete them  
- Skip tagging people unless they explicitly request it  
- Treat community albums as confidential — no screenshots or forwarding without consent

---

## If Something Feels Off

Tell the Consent Crew or organizers right away. We’d rather have an awkward conversation than a broken container. Your instinct to protect the space is part of the culture here.

## How to Use This Page

Think of this as the catchall for policies that don’t warrant full pages of their own. For anything detailed — tickets, travel, accommodations — follow the links to the canonical guides.

---

## Tickets & Money

- Refunds are available up to **3 weeks before the gathering**; after that we can’t issue cash back  
- Need to resell, gift, or defer your ticket? Check in with us first so we can vet the new human  
- Arriving late (after Wednesday 21:00 Opening Circle) isn’t an option

Full details live in: [Cancellation & Refund Policy](cancellation-policy) and [Ticket Transfers & Resale](ticket-transfers)

---

## Photography & Privacy

This is a consent-first space. Only take images when you have explicit permission from everyone in frame, keep cameras unobtrusive, and be prepared to delete on request. When sharing publicly, anonymize the venue, confirm consent again, and delete if anyone revokes permission.

Full guidance lives in → [Photography Guidelines](photography-guidelines)

---

## Venue Respect

Clean as you go, return gear to where you found it, and treat communal areas like a beloved friend’s home. Waste sorting, bathroom etiquette, and checkout instructions are spelled out in [Leave No Trace & Space Care](leave-no-trace).

---

## Health & Safety

### Before You Arrive

- Skip the gathering if you’re sick or contagious  
- Bring medications and mobility aids you rely on  
- Tell us in advance about health needs or accessibility requests  
- Check in with yourself: do you have the capacity for an immersive communal experience right now?

### During the Event

- Eat, hydrate, and rest — intensity lands softer when your body has fuel  
- Use quiet spaces, FWBs, or organizers when you need support  
- Leave if you must; re-enter when you’re ready  
- Report concerns early so we can respond with care

### Consent, Substances & Transparency

- Consent is continuous and can be withdrawn at any moment  
- “No” and “I’m done” are complete sentences  
- Read non-verbal cues; when in doubt, pause and check in  
- Be honest about your headspace and any substances (alcohol, cannabis, prescriptions, anything) that could impact your judgment or ability to consent  
- If you witness something troubling, flag the Consent Crew — you’re not “making a fuss,” you’re stewarding the container

---

## Emergencies & Support

- Consent Crew: introduced at Opening Circle, available day and night  
- First aid: trained responders on site; nearest hospital is in Mol (~10 minutes)  
- Crisis support: ask for help early; we’d rather over-support than miss a rupture

_Times are gentle guides, not rigid rules. The energy of the group takes precedence._

---

## Unconference Sessions (Peer-Led)

**When:** Throughout Thursday–Sunday (approx. 10 AM–5 PM)
**Format:** Lightly facilitated, participant-driven
**Philosophy:** Less about formal training, more about shared experiences

**What You'll Find:**

- Rope technique shares and deep dives
- Conversations about dynamics, consent, and power
- Embodiment practices and body work
- Creative projects and artistic expressions
- Philosophical discussions about desire, connection, ritual
- Quiet practices (meditation, journaling, yoga)

### The Four Unconference Rules

1. **Whoever shows up are the right people.**
2. **Whatever happens is the only thing that could have.**
3. **Whenever it starts is the right time.**
4. **It's over when it's over.**

That's it. That's the magic.

### What Might You Offer?

No experts. Just people bringing what's alive.

**What could you bring?**

- A conversation you're hungry to have (e.g., navigating polyamory at gatherings)?
- A skillshare on something you love (e.g., giving a grounding massage, a specific rope technique)?
- A quiet, shared practice (e.g., a guided meditation or an hour of journaling together)?
- A deep dive into a tricky topic (e.g., power dynamics, aftercare, neurodivergence in play)?
- A question or body puzzle you want to explore with others?

We're here for the offbeat, the half-formed, the personal.
If you care about it, someone else probably does too.

## Skill-Shares & Workshops

**Led by community members, covering topics like:**

- Advanced rope techniques
- Tying for different bodies
- Consent negotiation frameworks
- Nervous system regulation and somatic work
- Aftercare and emotional processing
- Photography and documentation ethics
- Relationships and polyamory navigation

---

## ❓ Questions About the Schedule?

The schedule is **intentionally flexible** to honor:

- The energy of the group
- The needs of the moment
- Spontaneous brilliance
- Collective wisdom

If you have specific questions about timing, accessibility needs, or how something will work, **[reach out](/docs/contact)** — we're here to help.

## Care as a Way of Being

Consent isn't a question; it's the water we swim in.

This gathering asks a lot of you — emotionally, energetically, relationally. So we've built in care. Not just as a safety net, but as a way of being.

These pages are here to support you before, during, and after your time at Bottoms Up!. Whether you're feeling overwhelmed, excited, cautious, curious — you're not alone. We've thought about you.

### Consent & Support

- [**Consent & Safety**](consent-framework) — Celebrate the no, practice ongoing consent, and meet the Consent Crew
- [**Support & Care Systems**](support-care) — FWBs, bracelets, conscious care of space, and how we hold each other
- [**Neurodivergent Support**](neuro) — How we make space for different brains and bodies

### Emotional Preparation

- [**Emotional Wellbeing**](emotional-wellbeing) — Managing baggage before arrival and caring for yourself during the gathering
- [**Arriving with Partners**](partners) — Honoring existing bonds while staying open to emergence

### After the Gathering

- [**After the Gathering**](after-integration) — Immediate care, integration support, and staying connected

---

Read what you need. Leave what you don't.
These resources are here for your breath, your nervous system, your sense of safety — and your freedom to go deep, knowing you're held.

## First 48 Hours

Sleep. Eat. Hydrate. Move gently. Avoid big decisions.

Your nervous system is integrating. Expect tiredness, emotions, vivid dreams, sensitivity—all normal.

**Subdrop** (emotional low after intensity) is real but temporary. Signs: emptiness, disconnection, lethargy. If it hits: reach out to the community, call a friend, see a therapist.

**Crisis?** Use your local or national crisis line or emergency services. If you're working with a therapist, reach out to them as soon as you can.

---

## First Week

### Community Debrief

We typically organize a community debrief call in the days after. Watch for details in the WhatsApp group and email.

### Photos & Memories

- Photos will be shared (check your email for access details)
- Respect privacy: treat community albums as private and never screenshot or forward without consent
- Want to post something publicly later? → The "After the Gathering" section of [Photography Guidelines]({{< ref "/docs/practical/photography-guidelines" >}} "Photography Guidelines") explains exactly how to do that (consent, anonymity, deletion on request)

### Connect with People You Met

Email [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) with names to facilitate. Reach out directly if you remember them.

### Journal Prompts

- What surprised you?
- What do you want to carry forward?
- How does your body feel?

---

## Integration Support

### If You're Feeling Lonely

The end of an intense gathering can feel isolating. The remedy is reconnection.

**What helps:**

- Join the WhatsApp community immediately
- RSVP for the monthly community call
- Reach out to someone you met (even a small message)
- Go to a local rope jam or kink community event
- Plan to attend the next gathering NOW (tickets often sell out)
- Get a therapist who understands rope/kink

**You are not alone.** The people you met are feeling this too. Many are reaching out. Meet them.

### If You're Struggling with Emotions

Rope events stir up feelings — fear, joy, grief, desire, vulnerability. This is part of the work. But sometimes the feelings are overwhelming.

**What helps:**

- Talk to someone (friend, community member, therapist)
- Move your body
- Practice grounding (feet on earth, 5-4-3-2-1 sensory awareness)
- Reach out to the community support channel
- Remember: feelings pass

**If you're in crisis:**

- Use your local or national crisis line
- Go to an ER or emergency department if you're unsafe
- Call a trusted person

**Kink-competent therapists** understand rope, BDSM, power dynamics, and consent. They can help you process safely. If you'd like suggestions for kink-aware therapists, email us and we can share starting points where possible.

### If You Experienced Harm

If something happened at the gathering that crossed your boundaries or violated consent:

**You are not alone. We're here.**

1. **Reach out to the [Consent Crew]({{< ref "/docs/wellbeing/consent-framework" >}} "Consent & Safety")** — they're trained in support and accountability
   - Email: [consent-crew@roguerope.be](mailto:consent-crew@roguerope.be)
   - In-person: Consent Crew members are clearly identified at gatherings

2. **What happens next:**
   - You're heard and believed
   - We support YOU first (your safety, your healing)
   - We work toward accountability from the person who caused harm
   - We don't force confrontation or forgiveness
   - We help you access additional support if needed

3. **Additional support:**
   - Trauma-informed therapists (including kink-aware practitioners)
   - Crisis counseling and hotlines in your region
   - Support groups for BDSM/kink survivors (online and local)

**You deserved better. We're committed to accountability and repair.**

### If You're Processing a Relationship Change

Sometimes rope gatherings shift relationships — romantic partnerships, friendships, or self-understanding.

**This is deep work. You might:**

- Feel closer to your partner (or want to leave)
- Realize something about yourself
- Grieve a friendship or dynamic that changed
- Experience unexpected jealousy or desire
- Feel alone or unseen in your "regular" life

**What helps:**

- Talk to your partner or friend (honest, vulnerable conversations)
- Journal about what's shifting
- Get support from the community (others have navigated this)
- See a therapist who understands polyamory/kink/relationship complexity
- Attend the next gathering (these events create lasting transformation over time)

## Understanding Consent

### The Short Version?

If it feels like you're selling something — stop.
If you're working too hard for a "yes,"
pause.
Step back.
Try again — or maybe, don't.

A real yes doesn't need convincing.
Look for the "HELL YES." The "OMG YES."
Or better yet: the quiet, steady *yes* that lives in the body.

**Trust us — that kind of yes leads to better everything.**

[Watch this video about enthusiastic consent →](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqBQH1e7XwQ "Enthusiastic Consent!")

---

### Celebrate the No

Someone says no?
Good. That means they trust you enough to be honest.

Say thank you.
Mean it.

A "no" is not a rejection — it's a reveal.
It shows you something real: that this person feels safe enough to voice their boundary.
That's not a failure of connection — that's the foundation of it.

When someone says no, it proves they're present.
It proves they're paying attention to what they want — and what they don't.
And when we receive that no with grace, we show we're worthy of trust.

Every healthy dynamic — sexual, sensual, kinky, or otherwise — is built on the ability to **hear no, hold it, and stay open**.

So don't rush past it. Don't shrink from it.
Celebrate it.

Because if someone can say no, it means that when they say yes…
they really mean it.

And that's the kind of yes worth waiting for.

![Two people in caring dialogue, body language showing attentive listening and celebrating boundaries as gifts](/images/consent-dialogue.png)

### Consent Is a Whole-Body Experience

> "Consent isn't a question. It's a state.
> If, instead of lovers, the two of you were synchronized swimmers, consent would be the water.
> It's not enough to jump in, get wet and climb out —
> if you want to swim, you have to be in the water continually."
> — [Yes Means Yes](https://www.yesmeansyes.com/consent/)

It's not just a yes or no.
It's a full-body signal. A living dialogue. A mutual, continuous agreement.

Consent means:
- You're both in it.
- You can change your mind at any time.
- A yes to one thing is not a yes to everything.
- You pay attention — not just to words, but to tone, tension, and body language.

We believe sex, kink, and rope all start from this same place:
A *shared*, excited, embodied yes.
The kind that moves you both.

---

## Consent in Practice

### Ongoing Consent

Consent is not a one-time agreement. It's a continuous conversation that includes:

- **Check-ins during play** — "How are you feeling?" "What do you need?"
- **Reading non-verbal cues** — body language, breathing, muscle tension
- **Honoring changes** — energy shifts, emotional responses, physical limits
- **Aftercare discussions** — processing what happened, how it felt

### When Things Get Complicated

Sometimes consent gets murky. Sometimes we misread signals or cross lines we didn't know existed. Sometimes we realize mid-scene that we're not as okay as we thought we were.

That's human. That's normal. What matters is how we respond:

- **Stop immediately** when someone says stop
- **Check in regularly** during intense scenes
- **Take responsibility** when you've overstepped
- **Seek support** when you need help processing

---

## Safety Guidelines

### Physical Safety

- **Know your limits** and communicate them clearly
- **Start slowly** with new partners or new activities
- **Use safety tools** (rope shears, safety signals, etc.)
- **Stay sober enough** to give and receive consent
- **Stop immediately** if someone says stop or uses a safeword

### Emotional Safety

- **Check in regularly** during and after intense experiences
- **Respect privacy** — not everyone wants their experience shared
- **Hold space** for emotions without trying to fix or minimize them
- **Ask before giving advice** or feedback
- **Honor different processing styles** — some need talk, some need quiet

### Community Safety

- **Speak up** if you witness concerning behavior
- **Support others** in maintaining their boundaries
- **Honor pronouns: ask first, use them correctly, correct yourself with care.**
- **Use our support systems** (Consent Crew, FWBs) when needed
- **Take breaks** when you need them
- **Respect the container** we've created together

Remember: Safety isn't about avoiding all risk — it's about taking conscious, consensual risks with people who care about your wellbeing as much as their own.

---

## Consent Crew: Your Support Team

### Who We Are

The Consent Crew is a small, dedicated group of individuals trusted by the organization. We are here to serve as a resource for any issues related to consent, boundaries, and conflict resolution. Our role is to listen, offer support, and help facilitate repair when things get difficult.

We are not mediators in a formal sense, but rather a compassionate first point of contact to help you feel heard and find a path forward.

### What We Do

You can approach the Consent Crew for:

- **Navigating a difficult conversation** about boundaries or consent
- Support if you've **experienced a boundary violation**
- Help understanding the **consent framework** of the event
- A **confidential listening ear** if something feels off and you're not sure what to do next
- Follow-up on any reported issues to ensure they are handled with care

### How We're Different from FWBs

**Consent Crew** focuses on consent violations, boundary issues, and conflict resolution. We're here when something has gone wrong or feels unsafe.

**FWBs (Friendly, Welcoming, Buddies)** focus on peer support, emotional wellbeing, and general care. They're here for the everyday navigation of community and connection.

Both are essential parts of our care network, and you can approach whichever feels right for your situation.

### How to Find Us

Consent Crew members will be clearly identified during the opening circle. We'll also have a contact method available (usually a phone number) for anyone who needs to reach us quickly or discretely.

**Remember: You don't need to handle difficult situations alone.** We're here specifically to support you.

---

## If Something Feels Off — Tell Us

If someone on the attendee list is raising red flags, if you've had an issue with someone, or if you've witnessed behavior that concerns you — **please let us know.**

You can:

- Email us via the [contact page]({{< ref "/docs/contact" >}} "Contact us")
- Message us privately (FetLife, Signal, or whichever channels you already use with organizers)
- Use a pseudonymous email (ProtonMail, Tuta, etc.) if you prefer to stay partially anonymous

Share what happened, what you need, or how you'd like us to hold it. If you have ideas for boundaries, follow-up, or safety plans, include those too.

We'll listen. We'll think.
We'll follow up with care, not with assumptions.

---

## Want to Support Consent Culture Here?

We're always looking for folks who care deeply about presence, safety, clarity, and repair.

## Emotional Safety Matters Just as Much as Physical Safety

Bottoms Up! can stir a lot.
Connection. Intensity. Joy. Tenderness.
And sometimes — disorientation, overwhelm, or loneliness.

Whether it's a hard conversation, a crash after a scene, or just missing the familiar rhythms of home… it's okay. You're not doing it wrong.

This page holds guidance for your emotional journey: preparing before you arrive, caring for yourself during the gathering, and understanding what might come up.

---

## Before You Cross the Threshold

Every one of us carries stories: heartbreaks, unresolved fights, jealousy, shame, grief, burnout.
That's human. It's also **volatile tinder** in a space like Bottoms Up!—where intensity, intimacy, and erotic charge run high.

Here's the truth:

> **Whatever you bring in—light or dark—will get amplified.**
> If it's wonder, the place will glow.
> If it's unspoken resentment, it can overflow into disruption.

This is a loving caution. A reminder to **pause, scan, and sort** your inner luggage before you enter the space.

### Name It, Tame It, or Leave It

1. **Name It**
   - Say it out loud (to yourself, a friend, a journal): _"I'm still angry at X."_
   - Hidden baggage loves the dark; naming switches on the light.

2. **Tame It**
   - Do the pre‑work: therapy session, hard conversation, breathwork, long run—whatever helps you find steadiness.
   - If it can't be fully solved, at least give it a safe container.

3. **Leave It**
   - Some loads are too fresh, too sharp. That doesn't make you weak—just honest. If the weight feels un‑carry‑able, it might be kinder to sit this gathering out (or arrive later, in a different year).

### Relationship Storms & Drama Triangles

- **Arriving with tension?** Name it together first. Decide: _Pause it, resolve it, or postpone the gathering._
- **Love triangles & undefined connections?** Get explicit now. Vagueness becomes violence when the energy spikes.
- **Recent break‑ups?** If seeing this person tie someone else might rip you apart, love yourself enough to wait.

This gathering isn't therapy. It's not neutral ground. It's a **magnifier**.

### Respect the Shared Space

This space holds many bodies, many hearts.
Personal storms can swirl into collective weather.

- **Don't process loudly in public zones.** Find a quiet corner or schedule time off‑site.
- **Consent to unload.** Ask before dumping heavy feelings on someone who may be tapped out.
- **Use the support web wisely.** FWBs, Consent Crew, quiet spaces—they're resources, not emotional dumpsters.

### Common Baggage Types

**Recent relationship changes:** Breakups, new relationships, shifting agreements, or major life transitions can all destabilize your emotional ground.

**Unresolved conflicts:** Ongoing tensions with existing partners, friends, or community members will likely surface in intimate spaces.

**Past trauma:** This gathering can trigger unexpected memories or reactions. Come prepared with your coping strategies.

**Shame or insecurity:** About your body, your experience level, your desires, or your worthiness of connection and pleasure.

**Scarcity fears:** Around attention, desirability, or access to the kinds of connections you want.

### When to Consider Not Attending

Sometimes the most caring choice is to wait. Consider postponing if:

- You're in acute crisis or trauma recovery
- You have unresolved conflicts with others who will be attending
- Your relationship system is unstable and can't handle additional stress
- You're using the gathering to avoid or escape unaddressed life issues
- You don't have adequate emotional support systems outside the event

This isn't rejection — it's wisdom. The gathering will exist again, and you can arrive when you're more resourced.

## During the Gathering

### Common Emotional Experiences

**Drop / Crash**
After an intense scene or connection, you might feel a sudden emotional or energetic low. This is normal. Rest, hydrate, reach for gentle company or quiet solitude.

**Overwhelm**
Too much stimulation, too many choices, too much intensity. Find a quiet space, breathe, limit sensory input, and let yourself reset.

**Loneliness in Connection**
Being surrounded by people can sometimes highlight how alone you feel. Seek one-on-one connection or intentional solitude.

**Processing Waves**
Experiences here can stir unexpected feelings — old memories, new insights, complicated reactions. Let them move through you rather than fixing them immediately.

### A Few Things That Might Help

- Be gentle with yourself. Take breaks. Drink water. Cry if you need to.
- Listen to your body — and let it guide your pace.
- Set your boundaries clearly, and hold them with love.
- Say no when you need to. Say yes only when it's real.
- Focus on what feels *right* for you — not what others are doing.
- Ask for help. Even if it feels awkward. Especially then.

---

## If You Need Support — Look for a Bracelet

Care here isn't assigned. It's shared.

When someone wears a **FWB bracelet**, it means they're open to holding space — for a check-in, a grounding moment, a quiet sit under the trees. When you feel strong enough to care for others, you can wear one too.

Look for a bracelet when you need:

- A check-in or grounding moment
- Someone to listen without trying to fix
- Help connecting with resources or other support people
- Aftercare support following intense scenes
- A friendly presence when you're feeling alone

You can also always approach:

- A trusted friend or fellow attendee
- A [Consent Crew member](consent-framework) — they're here for boundaries, repair, or if something feels off
- Or just someone who looks like they might get it — we're all learning to read each other, gently

### You Won't Be Judged Here

If something feels off — we don't rush to blame or label.
We look for what can help.
Sometimes that's a conversation. Sometimes it's a hug and a snack. Sometimes it's space.

We'll figure it out together.

![animated drawing of two people hugging](/images/rrc25/encounter.png)

![A solitary mythic creature in a quiet contemplative moment, peacefully processing](/images/rrc25/processing.png)

## Creating Boundaries

### Before arriving:

- Identify your emotional, physical, and energetic limits
- Communicate clearly with partners about expectations and agreements
- Make plans for self-care and support during the gathering

### During the gathering:

- Check in with yourself regularly about your capacity and comfort
- Communicate boundaries clearly and kindly to others
- Ask for what you need without apology or over-explanation
- Say no when something doesn't feel right

### After the gathering:

- Process the experience with trusted friends or partners
- Notice what came up that might need attention in your regular life
- Integrate insights slowly rather than making major changes immediately

Remember: Boundary-setting is an act of care for both yourself and the community.

---

## Self-Care Strategies

- **Do your emotional homework** before arriving
- **Bring trusted coping mechanisms** (breathing techniques, grounding practices, etc.)
- **Have realistic expectations** about what the gathering can and can't provide
- **Plan for integration time** after the gathering to process what comes up
- **Consider therapy or counseling** support before and after intense experiences

---

This place is intense because it's real.
And real things take courage.

Let yourself be soft here, too.

### Neurodivergence Is Welcome. So Is Self-Knowing.

Bottoms Up! welcomes the full spectrum of how brains and bodies move through the world.

Autism, ADHD, anxiety, PTSD, sensory sensitivity, dyslexia, executive dysfunction, social burnout, panic loops, self-medication…  
Whatever you're navigating — you're not too much, and you're not alone.

But we’ll say this plainly:

**There is no dedicated neuro-support crew.**

There are no therapists, no designated liaisons.  
Just a gathering full of people doing their best — including you.

---

## What That Means

- **You are the expert on your needs.**  
  We trust you to know what helps — and to bring it with you.

- **Support is peer-based and informal.**  
  If you’re struggling, reach out to someone you trust. That might be a friend, a partner, a fellow participant.  

- **Care flows in all directions.**  
  If you’re able to support someone else, beautiful. If not, that’s okay too. Don’t overextend yourself to meet someone else’s regulation needs. You don’t have to.

- **The quiet space is open to all.**  
  No forms, no check-ins. Just a soft, low-stim place to decompress if the outside gets too loud.

---

### Resources We Provide

**Physical accommodations**

- Quiet, low-stimulation spaces for decompression  
- Clear signage and info about how the venue is laid out  
- Flexibility to opt in and out so you can pace yourself  
- Basic sensory tools on hand (earplugs, eye masks, fidgets)

**Social accommodations**

- Zero expectation to attend everything  
- Multiple ways to connect: verbal, non-verbal, structured, free-form  
- Acknowledgement that social energy is finite and valid to protect  
- FWBs available for gentle peer support

**Communication support**

- Clear, direct guidelines you can reference in writing  
- Permission to ask for clarifications and repeat info  
- Understanding that processing styles and speeds vary

---

### Self-Care Strategies

Bring or arrange what keeps you regulated:

- Sensory tools (noise-cancelling headphones, weighted items, textures)  
- Executive function aids (timers, schedules, reminders)  
- Emotional regulation supports (comfort objects, grounding techniques)  
- Communication scripts or cards for tricky conversations

Taking care of your neurodivergent needs isn’t selfish — it’s how you show up authentically for connection.

---

## A Note on Self-Medication

We know some folks use tools — prescribed or not — to navigate the world more comfortably.  
As long as you’re mindful of **impact**, **boundaries**, and **consent**, we’re not here to police how you care for yourself.

That said:  
**If your choices are affecting others**, we’ll step in. Autonomy only works when it includes accountability.

---

## Be Real With Yourself

This gathering is raw, intense, and immersive.  
It can be magical. It can also be too much.

If you know you need more structure, more predictability, or more emotional scaffolding than this space can offer — **that’s okay.**  
Saying no is a radical form of care, too.

If you do come, come prepared. With tools. With a plan. With your own signals and boundaries.

---

Bottoms Up! isn’t designed for ease.  
It’s designed for truth.

And we trust you to meet it in the way that’s right for you.

## Arriving with Partners

### Arriving Together

You're coming with someone you already share something with.  
That's beautiful.

Maybe it's a long-term partnership.  
Maybe it's new.  
Maybe it's undefined — a rope connection, a playmate, a lover, an anchor.

Whatever shape it takes: you already have some shared language. Maybe some shared history. Maybe shared boundaries.

This page is here to help you **stay grounded in that connection** — while still opening to the space around you.

### About That Bubble

It's natural to stick close when you arrive with someone you trust. Especially in intense, sensual, or unfamiliar spaces.

But intimacy doesn't have to mean insulation.  
And connection doesn't have to mean containment.

We invite you to stay open.
To soften the edges of your "we" — while still opening to the space around you.

> Try orbiting. Try weaving. Try being findable.  
> Let people know how you move: "I'm here with someone — and also open to new energy."

This isn't about splitting up.  
It's about **making room for emergence**.

### Playing Together

Whether you're tying, topping, bottoming, watching, or just breathing in sync:

- **Check in.** Even if it's familiar. Especially if it's familiar. Event energy can stir things up.
- **Tend to the space.** Public play creates atmosphere — be aware of how you're shaping it.
- **Plan for aftercare.** Bring a blanket. Leave space. Make time to land back in each other.

### Playing Separately

Some of you arrive with **non-monogamous agreements**, or **independent playstyles**. Others might discover desires at the event you didn't expect.

We celebrate that.

Some suggestions:

- **Have the awkward conversations early.** Agreements, boundaries, intentions — get clear before you get hot.
- **Don't assume symmetry.** One of you might explore more than the other. That's okay. Move at your own paces with care.
- **Plan for reconnection.** Not just physically. Emotionally, too. Even a 5-minute cuddle check-in can shift everything.

### If Things Get Wobbly

They might. That's not failure — that's reality.

Event energy is raw. Beautiful, but activating. You might feel:

- Protective
- Left out
- Jealous
- Tender
- Surprised by your own reactions

**This is normal.** Here's what helps:

- **Pause before reacting.** Take a breath, find some space, check your emotional state
- **Talk to your person privately.** Don't process in public or through other people
- **Use the support systems.** FWBs can help you sort through unexpected feelings
- **Remember your agreements.** Return to what you decided together before arriving
- **Be gentle with each other.** This intensity can bring up old wounds or new insights

### When You Need Backup

You don't have to hold wobbles alone.

- Look for someone wearing an [FWB](support-care) bracelet if you need grounding or a compassionate witness
- Reach out to the [Consent Crew](consent-framework) for boundary repair, mediation, or if something feels off
- Use the quiet spaces, go for a walk, or find a soft corner where you can land together
- Ask trusted friends or constellation members for support if you already have shared agreements

Let the community catch you when you need it. That's why we're all here.

### Relationship Configurations

**Monogamous couples:** You're welcome here whether you play only with each other or not at all. The gathering offers many forms of connection beyond physical play.

**Non-monogamous folks:** Great! Communicate clearly with existing partners and new connections about boundaries and expectations.

**Solo but partnered:** Coming alone while partnered elsewhere requires extra care in communication both directions.

**Single and exploring:** You're not expected to find a partner here, but if connections emerge, navigate them with the same care as everyone else.

**Relationship anarchists:** We love your approach to connection, just be clear about what you're offering and seeking.

And stay open to what's possible.

### Helpful Practices

- **Name your needs.** Out loud. Early. Kindly.
- **Check in daily.** Morning coffee or end-of-day recaps work wonders.
- **Make room for both togetherness and spaciousness.** Trust that you can stretch without breaking.

### Let Your Bond Be a Root — Not a Wall

You don’t have to fit a model. You don’t have to explain your dynamic. But you are invited to arrive with presence and openness.

Protect what’s sacred.  
And stay open to what’s possible.

## How Care Flows Here

Care at Bottoms Up! doesn't live with one team. It's a web: FWBs and friends, the Consent Crew, quiet spaces, conscious care of the venue, and organizers backing it all up.

Care isn't something the organizers provide.
It's something **we all create** — together, moment by moment.

This page shows you how the support systems work and how to plug into them.

---

## Friends With Benefits (FWBs)
_Yes, the good kind._

### What Is an FWB?

**Friend With Benefits** = someone who's willing to show up for others.
To hold space. To offer support. To check in. To notice.

Not all the time. Just when you feel able. Just when it's real.

FWBs aren't staff. They're **you**.
And when you're ready to offer care, you show it by putting on a bracelet.

This year, anyone can be an FWB. And we mean anyone.

### How It Works

- **Bracelets = Consent to Care**
  When you feel grounded and resourced enough to be available for others, slip on a FWB bracelet. That's your quiet signal: "I'm here if you need me."

- **No Pressure, No Performance**
  You can take it off at any time. There's no expectation to stay "on" all weekend. Your own capacity matters just as much as anyone else's needs.

- **Anyone Can Step In**
  This isn't a special role. It's a shared one. We all have moments where we can be the calm in the storm — and moments when we can't.

### Why We're Doing It This Way

Because **care can't be outsourced**.
Because the orga team can't hold it all — and shouldn't.
Because we believe in shared responsibility, not designated heroes.
**Because we want to see what happens when everyone at the gathering decides to care for each other.**

This bracelet system lets us flow in and out of service — with consent, clarity, and freedom.

### What FWBs Offer

When someone wears the bracelet, they're saying:

- **I can hold emotional check-ins** and really listen
- **I can help you ground** if things feel overwhelming
- **I can offer basic aftercare** — water, snacks, blankets, quiet presence
- **I can walk you through the space** if you're new or feeling lost
- **I can help de-escalate conflict** and connect you to other resources
- **I can be a friendly face** so you don't have to navigate a moment alone

FWBs are peers, not therapists or security. We help within our capacity and loop in the [Consent Crew](consent-framework) or orga when more support is needed.

### When You Might Reach for an FWB

- You're feeling wobbly and need grounding
- You need help navigating a tricky emotional moment
- You're not sure who to talk to about something that feels off
- You just need someone to walk with for a minute

FWBs aren't therapists or security. They're fellow participants.
If more support is needed, they'll help connect you with the [Consent Crew](consent-framework) or core team.

## Conscious Care of Space

### Care is not just what we do for each other —
it's what we do *with* each other.

Bottoms Up! isn't staffed. It's shared. That means the space only holds us as well as **we** hold it.

This isn't about being tidy.
It's about being *conscious*.
Of your body. Your stuff. Your impact. The people beside you.

### The Art of Noticing

You don't need a chore list. Just awareness.

- **Notice what's yours.**
  If you brought it — take it home. If you used it — clean it. If you dropped it — pick it up.

- **Notice what's off.**
  If something looks forgotten, lost, or misplaced, take initiative. Straighten it. Stash it. Set it aside safely. You don't need permission to help.

- **Notice the little things.**
  Wipe a surface. Carry a cup. Return a chair to its place. Small actions ripple.

- **Notice each other.**
  If someone leaves a trace behind — a cup, a shirt, a tool — offer a gentle reminder. Not judgment. Just care.

### We Are the Care Crew

You don't have to be a cleaner to care.
You don't have to be a "helper" to help.

Care isn't a task — it's a way of being in relationship with space, self, and others.

Let's leave every room better than we found it.
Let's make our messes part of the magic.
Let's take responsibility for what we touch, use, open, move, spill, or stir.

That's the kind of kink we're into.

**Care is contagious. Let's start the ripple.**

## Other Support Systems

### Emotional Wellbeing

Big feelings are part of the ride: drop, overwhelm, tenderness, loneliness, joy. [Emotional Wellbeing](emotional-wellbeing) explores what those waves can look like, practices that help, and how to lean on bracelets, friends, or quiet space when you need support.

### Neurodivergent Support

Different brains and bodies belong here. There's no dedicated neuro team, so we rely on peer care, clear info, flexible participation, and bringing the tools you need. The [Neurodivergent Support](neuro) page lists accommodations on site plus self-care strategies.

### Consent Crew & Orga

When something feels off, when a boundary gets crossed, or when you need backup for a hard conversation, the [Consent & Safety](consent-framework) crew is your first call. They coordinate with organizers as needed and can loop in FWBs or other resources.

### Quiet & Grounding Spaces

Need to downshift? The designated quiet zone is always available for decompression, naps, meditation, or simply less input. Conscious care of the space — tidying as we go, noticing what's needed — keeps those havens ready.

## How to Plug In

- **Ask for care** early; don't wait until you're underwater.
- **Offer care** only when you genuinely have capacity — bracelets make it clear.
- **Loop in support** (FWBs, Consent Crew, orga) when situations stretch beyond peer listening.
- **Keep an eye on the web.** If you notice a gap, name it; if you have an idea, share it.

You don't have to hold everything yourself. Let the system hold you, and feed it when you can.

## This Is How We Care

We're not building a support team.
We're building a **support culture**.

And it starts with trust — that you'll step up when you can, and step back when you can't.
That someone will see you. That someone will stay.

So if it feels right, slip on the bracelet.
And if you need care? Look for one glowing on someone's wrist.

We've got each other.
That's what makes this gathering work.
