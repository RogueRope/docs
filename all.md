## The Flow of Our Days

**A rough outline. We'll adjust to what the camp needs.**

This isn't a scheduled program. It's a gentle container for what wants to emerge when people show up fully present, ready to connect, and willing to be real.

---

## Wednesday Afternoon – Build Begins

Come early if you can.
Not because we need help (though we do), but because this is one of the best ways to arrive.

There's something sacred about shaping the space before it holds us.
Hanging lights. Painting signs. Arranging the lounge areas.
Making coffee. Making eye contact. Making meaning.

No skills required. Just hands. Just heart. Just presence.

---

## Wednesday – We Land

This is arrival day.
**Everyone is expected to arrive by Wednesday evening.**
Get settled in your space. Shake off the outside world. Step in slowly.

And then, as night falls:  
**The Opening Circle begins at 21:00.**  
This is a sacred threshold — a moment of collective breath, of shared arrival.  
Your presence matters. Be on time. Be all in.

Play begins after the circle, softly.

We ask you to begin with us. But you don't have to stay until the end.

If you find yourself overwhelmed, exhausted, complete — **it's okay to leave early**.  
We honor your limits. We celebrate your self-awareness.  
Tapping out is not failure. It's wisdom.

You know yourself best. We trust you.

---

## Thursday to Saturday – We Unfold

We begin Thursday morning with our **Consent Moment** —  
a guided, embodied check-in.  
Not just reminders, but rituals.  
It's mandatory. And it's meaningful.

From there, the days stretch open.

Jam spaces. Lounge whispers. Quiet rituals. Late-night laughter.
Rope in the space. Kisses in the dim light. Gentle movements. Soft eyes. Stillness. Play.

There will be peer-led offerings — nothing scheduled yet, everything possible.  
And we won't leave it all to chance.

---

## Sunday – We Unravel

For many, this is the soft close.
We gather our things. Tears come up.
We hold each other. We say goodbye.

But not everyone makes it to Sunday — and that's okay.

If you leave early, we'll miss you.
And we'll honor your choice.

Some people stay the whole time.
Some people leave halfway through.
Both are valid. Both are brave.

What matters is that you came at all.

---

## The Playground Is Wide

## Rope Is Just the Beginning

Yes, we love rope.  
But that's just the surface.

This is a space to play — with power, with surrender, with sensation, with self.  
It's a place where desire can stretch its legs. Where you can experiment, express, and explore without needing to perform.

Rope is our common language.  
But the dialects? Endless.

You don't need to be "good" at it.  
You don't need to know the names of the knots.  
You don't even need to tie.  
Curiosity is enough. Presence is enough. You are enough.

Come with an open body and a listening heart. That's all we ask.

### This is Not a Technical Skills Gathering

This is a living, breathing permission slip.

You'll find whips and wax, needles and nails, floggers and fire.  
You'll find the softest hands and the filthiest mouths.  
You'll find silence. You'll find sound.  
You'll find scenes that don't look like scenes at all — just two people, breathing together, holding a secret.

Nudity is welcome.  
Sexuality is not hidden.  
You don't have to dim your shine, your heat, your hunger.

This is a place where kink lives beside care.  
Where sex is sacred and messy and not up for anyone else's consumption.  
Where play can look like fucking — or crying — or lying in intimate embrace, wrapped in rope and connection, with someone watching over you.

# The Heart of It

Rope is a language. One of tension, stillness, surrender. It doesn't need applause. It doesn't need perfection. It needs presence.

This gathering asks you to tie like no one is watching. To meet through rope — not just with hands, but with honesty.

# New Here? Welcome.

Maybe you've never been to a rope gathering before.  
Maybe you've never been naked in public.  
Maybe you've never shared intimate space with strangers.  
Maybe you've never said out loud that you're kinky.  
Maybe you're not even sure if you are.

**That's okay.**

You don't have to arrive confident. Or experienced. Or loud.  
You don't have to tie. You don't have to undress. You don't have to explain.  
You just have to be curious. And kind. And willing to feel.

## This is Not a Place for Experts

This is a place for the real.

We've built Bottoms Up! for the ones who want something more. Not flashier. Not sexier. But **truer**.

If you're worried you won't know how to start a conversation — you're not alone. Most of us have felt that. So we've created icebreakers, gentle encounters, and open spaces that make it easier to connect. No games, no pressure. Just invitations.

If you're afraid you'll be the only one who doesn't know how it all works — you won't be. We celebrate beginners. We honor questions. We welcome quiet.

**You belong here as you are.**

*Want to understand the deeper philosophy behind this approach?* → [Core Philosophy](/concept/philosophy)

</div>

### What if I don't want to do rope?

That's fine. Truly. Rope is the thread, not the whole fabric. Some people come just to feel the atmosphere. To connect. To flirt. To cry. To kiss. To watch. To rest.

Rope is welcome. Not required.

### What if I'm coming alone?

A lot of people do. We'll help you find your way in. Whether through shared meals, structured play spaces, or spontaneous moments in shared spaces, there are many ways to connect — slowly, gently, honestly.

You might leave with people you didn't know you needed.

### What if I feel overwhelmed?

We expect that. This experience can be intense. There are quiet places, kind volunteers, and soft hands if you need them. You can always step away, lie down, take a breath, cry, laugh, or ask for help.

Consent means you get to choose — every time.

---

## Who Is This For?

This isn't for everyone. That's not a judgment — it's design.

Bottoms Up! works best when people arrive knowing what they're stepping into. So let's get honest about who thrives here and who might find what they need elsewhere.

### Are You Craving This?

**✨ Deeper connection in your rope practice?**  
This isn't about learning more knots or perfecting technique. It's about finding the intimacy, presence, and emotional resonance that make rope feel sacred.

**🤝 Authentic community over surface performance?**  
We value real conversation over rope tricks. Vulnerability over Instagram moments. Being seen for who you are rather than what you can do.

**🕊️ Safety that goes beyond physical technique?**  
We create space for consent that's enthusiastic, ongoing, and held collectively. Emotional safety matters as much as physical safety here.

**🌅 Time to slow down and feel deeply?**  
Four days to step away from rush culture. To breathe. To be present. To let intimacy unfold naturally without agenda or timeline.

### You'll Love This If...

**You're curious about rope** — whether you've never touched it or you've been tying for years. Experience level doesn't matter. Openness does.

**You value consent as an ongoing practice** — not just a checkbox, but a living dialogue that deepens intimacy and trust.

**You want to connect with like-minded people** — folks who see kink as a doorway to deeper humanity, not just a bedroom activity.

**You're comfortable with communal living** — shared meals, bunk beds, morning coffee conversations with people you just met.

**You can hold space for others' emotions** — tears, laughter, overwhelm, and joy are all welcome parts of this experience.

**You're ready to be fully present** — phones away, agendas aside, heart open to whatever wants to emerge.

### This Might Not Be Right If...

**You're looking for a rope session or skill-building event** — we're about connection, not curriculum. You'll learn plenty, but through experience rather than instruction.

**You prefer anonymous encounters** — this is intimate, communal, and heart-centered. People see and remember each other here.

**You need privacy and solitude** — we sleep in shared rooms, eat together, and spend most of our time in community.

**You're not ready to engage with emotions** — rope brings up feelings. Ours, others', unexpected ones. We hold that tenderly, but it happens.

**You're uncomfortable witnessing sexual expression** — while no one is required to participate sexually, intimate and sexual interactions will happen around you. If seeing others kiss, touch, or engage sexually makes you uncomfortable or triggers you, this gathering may not be right for you.

**You're seeking a party atmosphere** — this is contemplative, intentional, and sometimes quiet. Fun, yes. Wild party, no.

---

## Still Wondering?

Ask yourself:

💭 **Does this gathering feel like coming home to something I've been seeking?**

💭 **Am I ready to be vulnerable and hold space for others' vulnerability?**

💭 **Do I want to explore rope as a practice of intimacy and presence?**

💭 **Can I commit to five days of authentic engagement with a community?**

If you're feeling "YES" — even a nervous, excited, uncertain yes — then this might be exactly what you need.

*Ready to see what this looks like in practice?* → [Experience Structure](/concept/experience)

If you're feeling "maybe" or "I'm not sure" — that's perfectly valid too. Trust your instincts. There are many beautiful gatherings in the world. This one might not be yours right now, and that's okay.

You don't need to be ready. You just need to be here.

Come as you are. We'll meet you there.

## Tie Like No One Is Watching

At Bottoms Up!, we cherish the ties that bind — not just bodies, but hearts and breath, shadow and light. "Tie like no one is watching" isn't a performance note. It's an invitation to drop the mask. To meet through rope, not just with hands, but with honesty.

---

## The Essence of Rope

Rope is a language. One of tension, stillness, surrender. It doesn't need applause. It doesn't need perfection. It needs presence. 

Skill helps, sure. But the real magic lives in what can't be taught — those quiet, electric moments where something shifts between you.

Without eros, rope is just knots. With it, it becomes a ritual of longing and play and truth.

---

## Beyond the Workshop Mindset

It's tempting to chase knowledge. To fill a schedule, collect techniques, feel productive. But we've seen it: the hunger isn't really for more information. It's for connection. For experiences that linger.

The kind that don't come from sitting in a circle taking notes — they come from being brave enough to reach out.

**This isn't about downloading information.**  
**It's about transformation.**

We don't chase productivity. We don't sell certainty. What we're building is a community of risk-takers and tenderness-makers. People who want to feel more, not just know more.

---

## Embracing Eros

We don't shy away from it. We invite it.

Let's speak plainly: this is a sex-positive space. Not performative. Not expected. But deeply, unapologetically present. Desire is welcome here. So is reverence.

We honor the body as a site of play, of prayer, of power. For some, rope is foreplay. For others, it's sacred ritual. For many, it's both.

We don't separate the sensual from the spiritual. We light candles. We laugh mid-orgasm. We cry during aftercare. We create space for sex to be slow, strange, tender, filthy, or holy — and we let each person find their own rhythm.

Nothing is mandatory. Nothing is off-limits except violating consent.

---

## An Inclusive Sanctuary

This is a space for all bodies, all backgrounds, all orientations. We honor the rigger and the bottom equally — not as roles to perform, but as people to witness.

Rope isn't a hierarchy. It's a dance of trust, in whatever form it takes.

We don't divide people into experts and beginners. No badges, no titles, no status games. What we offer is a field full of possibility — where learning happens through doing, watching, asking, laughing.

There are no celebrity teachers here. No extra fees for insight. No backstage pass. Just people — tying, learning, crying, laughing, showing up. Everyone is a participant. Everyone belongs.

---

## Being Together: Our Shared Agreements

**We made a few agreements to keep this space honest, safe, and kind.**

- **Consent comes first, always.** Get it clearly, give it freely, and tune in to words and silence. Be grateful when someone trusts you with their truth.
- **Respect the humans around you.** Every person here carries a story. Be mindful, be curious, ask before touching, and honor pronouns.
- **Speak what's real.** Say what you mean and hear what's said. When things feel tender, choose clarity as a form of care.
- **Stay present.** Let the outside world wait. Be here with your body, your breath, and your attention.
- **Own your impact.** We all fuck up; what matters is what you do next. Apologize, repair, learn, and grow.
- **Play with awareness.** Kink, sex, and BDSM are welcome here, but never at the cost of safety or consent. Know your edges, respect others', and be gentle with power.
- **Take care of yourself.** Eat, hydrate, rest, and ask for what you need. You're not here to push through—you're here to be whole.

### Generosity as Love in Action

**Be generous.**  
Offer what you can: your time, your skills, your mischief, your warmth.

What counts as participation? All of it.

- Chopping onions  
- Hanging lights  
- Tidying the space  
- Holding someone who needs to cry  
- Tying rope, sharing a song, offering your favorite snack at 3am

There is no competition here. No one gets a gold star. Contribution looks different for everyone — and that's the point.

Whether you're a helper, a dreamer, a mischief-maker, or someone who simply holds the energy of care in a space... you belong.

---

## Who Belongs Here

This is a space for many.
But not for all.

Bottoms Up! welcomes queerness, neurodivergence, kink, softness, weirdness, and everything else that doesn't fit neatly into polite society. We hold space for shadow and play, for bodies that don't match expectations, for desires that don't ask permission.

We want you here if you come with curiosity.
We want you here if you long for honesty, connection, or the freedom to be as you are.
We want you here if you're ready to meet others with care, and to be met in return.

But let's be clear:

This is not a place for entitlement, for ego, or for domination without consent.
It's not a place for people who won't respect boundaries.
It's not a place for those unwilling to take responsibility for their impact.

If you're here to connect — for real — you're welcome.
If you're here to control, consume, or detach, you're not.

### Access Is Not the Same as Entitlement

We do our best to make this space financially and physically accessible.
**If money is the barrier, reach out.** We're ready to talk and find something that works.

Maybe that's a discount.
Maybe installments.
Maybe a trade.

We don't do shame. We do dialogue.

But access is a *shared responsibility*.
You still need to show up with presence. To tend to yourself and the people around you. To be ready for the intensity this space brings.

If you're not sure you're ready — that's okay.
Better to pause than to force it.

### The Intensity Is Real

This isn't a light weekend.
It's immersive. Emotional. Sensory. Beautiful — and intense.

Some people stay the whole time. Some leave early. Both are valid.

We support pacing and self-care. We encourage reflection before you say yes:
Are you in a place to give and receive in community?
To risk being seen as you are?

This space will hold you — if you also hold it.

---

## Post-Rope: A Gentle Rebellion

**Post-Rope** isn't a style, or a brand, or a club.  
It's a feeling — a quiet turning away from the noise.  
A refusal of the performance economy.  

We've grown tired of rope as content. Of stages. Of proving.  
We want rope that's messy, tender, human again.  

### Beyond the Performance

We've all seen it:  
Who's desirable. Who's collecting glances. Who's in the cool crowd.  

It's just heteronormativity replaying itself in rope — high school hierarchies nobody really enjoyed the first time.  

When the game is about catching eyes or proving worth, curiosity dies. Vulnerability hides. Encounters shrink to performance.  

### Breaking the Script

The moment we step outside that pattern, everything changes.  
People stop impressing. They start meeting.  
They risk awkwardness instead of polish.  
They reach for intimacy instead of recognition.  

That's when rope gets real again — not as spectacle, but as bridge.  

**Post-Rope looks like this:**  
- The kitchen tie that becomes a midnight heart-talk  
- The messy session that ends in laughter  
- The hug that means more than the knots  
- The silence where nothing "happens" but everything shifts  

### Against the Algorithm

In Post-Rope, we gently rebel against the scroll.  

We're tired of:  
- Rope flattened into content  
- Intimacy cut into reels  
- Quiet moments mined for clout  
- The pressure to *be seen* rather than *be*  

Here, no one ties for likes.  
No followers. No brands. No filters. Just people.  
Alive. Breathing. Together.  

---

## Designed for Serendipity

We design for encounters that might not happen unless we make space for them. This isn't a lineup of scheduled classes. It's a curated field of possibilities — moments of shared joy, awkward first hellos, spontaneous knots that turn into friendships.

The setting changes everything. You feel it when the atmosphere envelops your scene. When you move with intention in shared space. When rope becomes the bridge between souls in this carefully held container.

Here, we let go of the studio rules. We create suspension from within. The space becomes part of the play — intimate, alive, and endlessly welcoming.

---

## What We're Really After

Let's not pretend it's about rope alone.  
Let's name what it really is: **a longing to be met**.

Most of us don't struggle with what we want. We struggle with how to begin. That first moment — the glance, the ask, the touch — can feel like the hardest one. So we build bridges. We create gentle rituals and open invitations that help people find their way to one another.

At Bottoms Up!, you won't leave with a certificate.
You might leave changed.

---

Come if you're ready for something real.  
Come if you're craving something deeply connective.  
Come if you want to feel rope not just on your skin — but in your soul.

## We Are One of the Very Few

Most rope events sanitize sexuality. They keep eros at arm's length, treat desire as a side effect rather than the point, frame sexual expression as something to manage rather than celebrate.

Bottoms Up! is not most events.

We are **explicitly, unapologetically sex-positive**. And that's rare in the shibari world.

---

## What Sex-Positive Means (For Us)

**Not:** Porn-centric performance, exploitation, male-gaze spectacle, pressure to be sexual, crude or fetishy stereotypes.

**Yes:** Desire is sacred. Sexuality is part of our humanity. Eros belongs alongside rope, intimacy, and presence. People can express their sexuality—or choose not to—without apology.

Sex-positive means:
- Desire is normal, worthy, and beautiful
- Sexuality is diverse (some people want sex; some want intimacy; some want neither; all valid)
- Consent makes it ethical
- Mystery and sensuality matter more than explicitness
- We don't separate the body from the spirit

---

## Why It Matters

Most rope communities are built by and for people who had to hide their sexuality to stay safe. Rope was refuge—a place where desire could exist, but quietly. Gratefully. Apologetically.

We've inherited that caution.

But something shifts when we stop apologizing for desire. When we say openly: **Yes, sexuality is part of what we practice here. Yes, people will kiss, touch, make love, express pleasure. Yes, nudity happens. Yes, we light candles and we also light fire.**

That shift creates permission. Room. Freedom.

If you've been told your desire is too much, too weird, too kinky, too queer, too anything—this space says: **Not here. Here, your hunger is welcome.**

---

## How Sexuality Shows Up

**At the gathering, you might see:**
- People kissing during rope scenes
- Sensual touching that's sexual or sacred (sometimes both)
- Naked bodies being bound, touched, witnessed
- Scenes that are foreplay, lovemaking, or something with no name
- Pleasure. Sounds of pleasure.
- Intimacy that's tender, fierce, slow, urgent, playful, solemn

**You won't see:**
- Pressure to perform
- Objectification
- Spectacle for its own sake
- Exploitation

**You will feel:**
- Presence
- Consent
- Reverence for bodies and desire
- The sacred in the sensual

---

## The Distinction We Make

We're **not** a sex party. We're not a porn set. We're not a place where sexuality is the entertainment for voyeurs.

We're a space where people can explore sexuality **with dignity, presence, and care**. Where desire is woven into rope, into ritual, into connection.

Sex can be:
- A spiritual practice
- An expression of power and vulnerability
- A form of intimacy
- A way to be fully alive in your body
- Joyful, tender, intense, playful, sacred

All of this is welcome. And so is NOT participating. Your sexuality is yours—to express, to explore, or to keep private.

---

## Permission You Might Need

If you've been told:

**"You're too sexual for rope"** — You're not. Your desire is part of what makes rope alive.

**"That's not what shibari is supposed to be"** — This is what it can be when we stop gatekeeping.

**"Nice people don't talk about sex"** — We're not nice. We're real. Real includes desire.

**"I'm not brave enough to want this"** — Bravery isn't required. Just curiosity. Just honesty.

**"I'll be judged for my sexuality"** — Not here. We celebrate the full spectrum—from asexual to hypersexual and everything in between.

---

## Why This Matters for Rope

Rope is a language of vulnerability and power. Sexuality is where vulnerability gets most real, power most potent, truth most naked.

When we bind someone, we're asking: *Can you trust me with your body? With your desire? With your truth?*

That trust is erotic. It's also sacred. Both things at once.

Trying to do rope without acknowledging sexuality is like trying to do rope while pretending bodies don't exist. You're hiding the most important part.

We don't hide. We celebrate.

---

## What This Means for You

You can:
- Bring your full sexuality
- Express desire without apology
- Explore pleasure with a partner
- Watch others without judgment
- Sit quietly with your own desire
- Choose not to participate sexually
- Change your mind mid-gathering
- Have sex, or not have sex, or something else entirely

**You cannot:**
- Violate someone's consent
- Pressure anyone into sexuality
- Detach from presence (sex as performance is not welcome)
- Treat bodies as objects

---

## We're Building Something Different

Most rope communities exist in the margins, grateful for the space, not pushing back against the culture that says desire should be hidden.

We're building something different: a community where sexuality is named, honored, celebrated. Where you don't have to choose between being kinky and being respectable. Where desire and reverence live in the same moment.

This is rare.

That's why you're here.

## Wednesday Afternoon – Arrival & Build

**14:00–18:00** — Arrive whenever you can

- **Check-in:** Find the welcome table near the main entrance
- **You'll get:** Your room assignment, welcome packet with map, meal schedule
- **Settle in:** Go to your room, meet your roommates, arrange your bunk
- **Find the energy:** Explore common areas, grab a coffee, chat with early arrivals

**18:00–19:00** — Build Day (optional but magical)

- Hang lights, arrange lounge areas, set up the space
- Meet people while working side-by-side
- No skills needed — just hands and heart
- Most people who arrive early say this is when the magic starts

**19:00–20:00** — First Meal Together

- Dinner is communal — we all eat in the main space
- Find a seat, meet neighbors, shake off the outside world
- This meal is warm, filling, made with care

**20:30–21:00** — Settling In

- Return to your room, get comfortable
- Use the bathroom, brush your teeth, get ready
- Chat quietly with roommates
- The energy is building

---

## Wednesday Evening – Opening Circle

**21:00** — Opening Circle (Required)

This is the threshold. The moment we step in together.

**What happens:**
- We gather in a circle (all 42 of us)
- Introduction from organizers (what we're about)
- Consent Moment (embodied practice)
- How the space works (agreements, support, how to find help)
- We land together
- Takes about 45 minutes

**Why attend:** This ritual shapes everything that follows. It's not a lecture; it's a collective breath.

**After the circle:**
- Play might begin softly (some rope, some hanging out)
- You can participate or head to bed — both are fine
- The night is open-ended

---

## Thursday Morning – You're Here

You've slept (or listened to roommates sleep).

**9:00 AM** — Consent Moment (reinforcement)

A guided, embodied practice refreshing and deepening the consent framework from the Opening Circle. Short, meaningful.

**After that:**
- Breakfast/coffee in common area
- Jam spaces open (people tying, connecting)
- Unconference board posted (see what peer-led sessions are happening)
- You settle into the rhythm

You don't need to be ready. You just need to be here.

Come as you are. We'll meet you there.

### Dress Code: Urban Mystics & Enchanted Souls

This year, we invite you to **step into the space** and emerge as your truest, most authentic self — a being of intimate connection, of soft lights and shared stories.

Our theme: **Urban Mystics & Enchanted Souls**.

Picture it: sophisticated mystics with velvet robes, enchanting souls with flowing fabrics, artistic spirits with creative accessories, intuitive healers with meaningful symbols. A gathering of beings who connect deeply — and never needed to pretend.

Let your attire reflect the person within — or the one you long to become.

---

### Archetypes to Inspire

**Urban Mystics**: Sophisticated and enigmatic. Velvet robes, crystal accessories, intricate jewelry, mysterious pendants. Maybe a tarot-inspired accessory or a single meaningful symbol.

**Enchanted Souls**: Light, ethereal, and a little mysterious. Flowing fabrics, delicate accessories, glowing threads. Are you a night-soul or twilight-soul?

**Creative Spirits**: Artistic, expressive, eclectic. Mixed patterns, unique accessories, personal treasures — vintage buttons, creative patches, meaningful trinkets. Nothing matches. Everything tells a story.

**Intuitive Healers**: Wise, nurturing, transformative. Soft cloaks, healing crystals, symbolic jewelry. Maybe a meaningful pendant or a small book of inspiration. You're here for connection.

**Night Poets**: Elegant or passionate. Silk scarves, artistic jewelry, flowing layers, comfortable yet expressive. Choose romance, creativity, or both.

**Shape-Shifters**: Mix everything. Different fabrics and textures. Layers that express your mood. Let your look evolve over time. Let no one define you.

---

**Dress for ease, for touch, for breath.**

---

### Comfort is Sacred 
How much (or how little) you dress up is your call.
The space welcomes everyone — whether you're in elegant attire, comfortable loungewear, or creative expression.

We don't enforce this theme. It's an invitation, not a requirement.

And if you want to come as a purple hippo in a tutu? That's wonderfully expressive for us.

We can't wait to see who — or what — joins us.

## New here? Welcome.

If you've been with us before — welcome back to the warmth of connection.  
If this is your first gathering — breathe deep. You're exactly where you need to be.

This isn't a gathering for spectators. It's a sanctuary. For the curious. For the brave enough to be vulnerable. A space where desire whispers — never demands. Where rope is an invitation — never an obligation.

Four days to shed the rush. To sink into something slower, softer, more essential.

Come to tie. Come to surrender. Come to discover what lives in the spaces between.

## First 48 Hours

Sleep. Eat. Hydrate. Move gently. Avoid big decisions.

Your nervous system is integrating. Expect tiredness, emotions, vivid dreams, sensitivity—all normal.

**Subdrop** (emotional low after intensity) is real but temporary. Signs: emptiness, disconnection, lethargy. If it hits: reach out to the community, call a friend, see a therapist.

**Crisis?** Call [national crisis line] or [kink-informed therapist referral]

---

## First Week

### Community Debrief
We typically organize a community debrief call in the days after. Watch for details in the WhatsApp group and email.

### Photos & Memories
- Photos will be shared (check your email for access details)
- Respect privacy: no public screenshots or sharing without permission
- All shared under a private agreement
- If you choose to share publicly later, do it **only** with prior consent from everyone visible and **anonymize the venue**; delete on request.

### Connect with People You Met
Email [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) with names to facilitate. Reach out directly if you remember them.

### Journal Prompts
- What surprised you?
- What do you want to carry forward?
- How does your body feel?

---

## Stay Connected

**Join our WhatsApp community** — year-round connection, resources, next gathering updates. [→ Get the link]

**Monthly community calls** — Details shared in WhatsApp group

**Resources:**
Details on recommended books, therapist referrals, and support networks shared in the community.

- **Support Groups** for processing intense experiences

Ask in the community — people are always happy to recommend what helped them integrate.

---

## Specific Situations

### If You're Feeling Lonely

The end of an intense gathering can feel isolating. The remedy is reconnection.

**What helps:**
- Join the WhatsApp community immediately
- RSVP for the monthly community call
- Reach out to someone you met (even a small message)
- Go to a local rope jam or kink community event
- Plan to attend the next gathering NOW (tickets often sell out)
- Get a therapist who understands rope/kink

**You are not alone.** The people you met are feeling this too. Many are reaching out. Meet them.

---

### If You're Struggling with Emotions

Rope events stir up feelings — fear, joy, grief, desire, vulnerability. This is part of the work. But sometimes the feelings are overwhelming.

**What helps:**
- Talk to someone (friend, community member, therapist)
- Move your body
- Practice grounding (feet on earth, 5-4-3-2-1 sensory awareness)
- Reach out to the community support channel
- Remember: feelings pass

**If you're in crisis:**
- National crisis line: [number]
- Text crisis support: [number]
- Go to an ER if you're unsafe
- Call a trusted person

**Kink-competent therapists** understand rope, BDSM, power dynamics, and consent. They can help you process safely. [Referral list]

---

### If You Experienced Harm

If something happened at the gathering that crossed your boundaries or violated consent:

**You are not alone. We're here.**

1. **Reach out to the Consent Crew** — they're trained in support and accountability
   - Email: [consent-crew@roguerope.be](mailto:consent-crew@roguerope.be)
   - Phone: [number]
   - In-person: [staff available at gatherings]

2. **What happens next:**
   - You're heard and believed
   - We support YOU first (your safety, your healing)
   - We work toward accountability from the person who caused harm
   - We don't force confrontation or forgiveness
   - We help you access additional support if needed

3. **Additional support:**
   - Trauma-informed therapists: [Referral list]
   - Crisis counseling: [Numbers]
   - Support groups for BDSM/kink survivors: [Links]

**You deserved better. We're committed to accountability and repair.**

---

### If You're Processing a Relationship Change

Sometimes rope gatherings shift relationships — romantic partnerships, friendships, or self-understanding.

**This is deep work. You might:**
- Feel closer to your partner (or want to leave)
- Realize something about yourself
- Grieve a friendship or dynamic that changed
- Experience unexpected jealousy or desire
- Feel alone or unseen in your "regular" life

**What helps:**
- Talk to your partner or friend (honest, vulnerable conversations)
- Journal about what's shifting
- Get support from the community (others have navigated this)
- See a therapist who understands polyamory/kink/relationship complexity
- Attend the next gathering (these events create lasting transformation over time)

---

## Next Gathering

### When Is the Next One?

**Bottoms Up! 2027 (tentative):**

- What was confusing or missing
- How we can support you better
- Ideas for next time

Your feedback shapes how we evolve.

---

## A Final Word

You came. You were brave.
You opened your heart. You met yourself and others.
You moved something real.

That doesn't disappear because you left.

You carry this forward now. In your body. In your relationships. In your understanding of yourself.

The gathering doesn't end. It transforms.

We'll be here — in our community spaces, at the next event, in the emails and memories and late-night rope sessions you share with people you met.

You belong in this community.

Welcome home.

## Our Approach

We understand life happens. Plans change. Circumstances shift. We're not here to punish you for that.

**That said,** once you register, we commit resources — food, accommodations, supplies are ordered. Our policy balances your needs with our real costs.

---

## The Clear Rule: Up to 3 Weeks Before = Full Refund

**Cancellation window:** Up to 3 weeks before the event (by January 25, 2026)

**Refund:** 100% refund via our ticket vending system

**How to cancel:**
1. Log into your ticket vending account
2. Request cancellation/refund
3. Refund processes within 7 days to your original payment method

**Why this works:** This gives us time to sell your spot to someone on the waitlist, adjust food orders, and reallocate accommodations.

---

## After 3 Weeks: No Refunds

**Cancellation window:** Less than 3 weeks before the event (after January 25, 2026)

**Refund:** No refund

**Why:** We've already purchased food, locked in accommodations, and confirmed our supply chain. Your payment covers costs we've already incurred.

**BUT:** You have options (see [Ticket Transfers & Resale](/practical/ticket-transfers) for alternatives).

---

## Process for Cancellation

### Up to 3 Weeks Before (Refund Eligible)

1. Log into your ticket vending account
2. Click "Request cancellation"
3. Confirm request
4. Refund processes in 7 days

### After 3 Weeks (No Refund, But Options Available)

See [Ticket Transfers & Resale](/practical/ticket-transfers) for how to resell, defer, or request exceptions.

---

## Refund Method

### Where Does Your Money Go?

**Refunds (if approved) go to:**
- Your original payment method (credit card, bank transfer, etc.)
- Processing time: 7 days
- Check your bank; sometimes it takes a few extra days to appear

---

## Partial Attendance

### What If I Can Only Come 2–3 Days?

**You still pay full price** (€169).

**Why:** Food, accommodations, and support are bundled. We can't break them apart.

**But you can:**
- Leave early (Friday instead of Sunday): Totally fine; meals adjust but price stays same

**Important:** You must arrive by Wednesday 21:00 for the Opening Circle. If you cannot commit to this, this gathering may not be right for you.

**Better option:** If you need partial attendance, **reach out before registering.** Maybe we can work something out. But expect to pay full price.

---

## No-Show Policy

### If You Don't Show Up

**Without notice:**
- You forfeit your ticket (no refund)
- We keep your payment
- Your spot can't be reallocated

**With late notice:**
- See refund timeline above

**In emergency (hospitalized, accident, etc.):**
- **Contact us ASAP** when you're able
- We'll assess your situation
- Possible deferral or resale facilitation (depending on circumstances)

---

## Summary

| Timing | Refund | What to Do |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Up to 3 weeks before | 100% (via ticket vending) | Refund, resell, or defer |
| Less than 3 weeks | No refund | Resell, defer, or request exception |
| After event | No refund | N/A |

**Not sure if you should register?** Let's talk first. Better to be clear before committing than to cancel later.

## The Gathering

**Is this just 5 days?** Yes. Wed 18:00 – Sun 16:00. That's 5 full days—long enough to truly settle in, short enough to stay fully present.

**What time do I need to arrive?** **Wednesday by 21:00 for the Opening Circle — this is mandatory.** You must be present for this foundational ritual. If you can't make Wednesday evening, this gathering isn't the right fit for you this year. Leaving early is fine, but arriving on time is essential.

**Do I have to do rope?** No. Watch, connect, rest, or play. All of it's welcome.

**Is this sexual?** Yes. Sex-positive, sexual interactions happen. If seeing others kiss, touch, or express sexuality makes you very uncomfortable, this isn't your event. We're clear because consent is mutual.

**Will I know anyone?** ~30% come solo. You'll meet people. By day 2, you'll know folks. By day 4, you're part of something.

---

## Practical Details

**What's included?** €169 covers: 4 nights, all meals, spaces, support, basic equipment.

**Sliding scale?** Yes. Email [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) with "Financial access" — we offer discounts, payment plans, work exchange, no shame.

**How many people?** 42 max. Why? Intimacy without anonymity. We know each other's names.

**Who comes?** Mix of rope experience, queer, kinky, disabled, neurodivergent folks from across Europe. Beginners and experienced. Solo, couples, friend groups.

**Accessibility/disabilities?** Tell us when you register. We offer indoor rooms, ground-floor options, quiet spaces, flexible meals, volunteer support. Have specific needs? Email us early—we'll problem-solve.

**Food allergies?** Vegetarian/meat fully supported. Vegan best-effort. Special needs (gluten-free, etc.)? Tell us; we coordinate.

**What rope to bring?** 4x8m natural fiber (jute/hemp/cotton), scissors, a partner. Optional: your favorite rope/toys. Rope available on-site if you need it.

**Dress code?** No. Wear comfortable, intentional clothes. Layers. Something for the play party. Slippers for shared floors.

---

## Safety & Boundaries

**Consent framework?** Ask before touch. Respect "no." Check in during play. Continuous, not one-time. [Full framework →]

**Consent violation?** Find Consent Crew (identified at opening circle). You're supported first. We take it seriously. You're believed.

**First aid?** Yes, trained responders on-site. Hospital in Mol (~10 min).

**Overwhelmed?** Quiet spaces available. Find an FWB (support person). Rest, cry, leave if needed. Your wellbeing comes first.

---

## Before & After

**How to prepare?** Read [Getting Started] and [Philosophy]. Reflect on why you're coming. Talk to your partner if you have one. Arrive open.

**Subdrop?** Emotional low after intensity. Rest, hydrate, move your body, reach out. It passes. [→ After the Gathering for support]

**Stay connected?** Join our WhatsApp community, attend monthly calls, sign up for mailing list. [→ After the Gathering for details]

---

## Early Arrival (Build Day)

### Why Arrive Early?

**Build Day is Wednesday starting around 14:00.** This is the best way to arrive because:
- Meet people before the intensity begins
- Help shape the space (hang lights, arrange comfort areas)
- Soften into the energy gradually
- Skip some of the arrival rush
- Get your pick of rooms/bunks

### Wednesday Arrival Flow

**14:00–18:00** — Arrive, check in, unload, settle into your room
**18:00–19:00** — Build Day work (optional but wonderful)
**19:00–20:00** — First meal together
**21:00** — Opening Circle (mandatory, transformative)
**21:30+** — Play begins softly

### Wednesday 21:00 is Mandatory

**You must arrive by Wednesday 21:00 for the Opening Circle.** This is not flexible.

This ritual is the threshold—it shapes how we hold space together, sets our collective agreements, and creates the energetic foundation for everything that follows.

If you cannot commit to being present Wednesday evening, this gathering isn't the right fit for you this year. We'd rather you honor your real capacity and join us when you can fully show up.

**No late arrivals.** Plan accordingly.

---

## Nearby Accommodations (If You Need Them)

### Hotels & Accommodations

If you're arriving from far away and want to rest before Wednesday, search "hotels in Mol, Belgium" or nearby towns for Tuesday night stays. This gives you time to settle before heading to the venue for the Wednesday 21:00 Opening Circle.

### Airbnb/Vacation Rentals

Search Mol on Airbnb if you're traveling from far away and want to rest before Wednesday. You can stay nearby Tuesday night or early Wednesday, then arrive at the venue for the Opening Circle at 21:00.

## The Basic Idea

Care for shared space is collective. Notice what's yours. Pick it up. Clean what you use. Respect what others have left.

---

## During the Event

**Meal areas:**
- Clean up immediately after eating
- Wipe your table
- Don't leave food out

**Play spaces:**
- Wipe down equipment after use
- Coil rope and return it
- Return furniture to its place

**Sleeping areas:**
- Keep your bunk organized
- Don't leave clothes on floors
- Return shared items to their place

**Bathrooms:**
- Shower quickly
- Wipe surfaces
- Dispose of menstrual products in provided bins

**General:**
- Take trash with you
- Put lights out when you leave rooms
- If you see something off, fix it or report it

---

## Final Day Checkout

- Strip your bed
- Collect all your belongings
- Clean your bunk area
- Return room key
- Leave nothing behind except gratitude

---

## After You Leave

**Sharing photos publicly (FetLife, Instagram, blogs):**
Only share shots where **every person** consented **before** the photo **and** to **public posting**.
**No bystanders.** **Anonymize the venue** (no names, wide establishing shots, signage, maps, time/location details).
Be ready to **delete** if anyone changes their mind later.

**Respect people's privacy online.** Don't out anyone. Don't tag without consent. Protect the sacredness of what happened.

---

## Why It Matters

When we leave space better than we found it, we:
- Show respect for the venue
- Demonstrate consent (even to the building)
- Practice caring—which is what this gathering is about
- Make the next gathering possible

**It becomes a practice you carry into your life.**

## Build Day - Wednesday Afternoon

### Arrival flows into build.

Bottoms Up! doesn't just *appear*.
It's built — by hands, by hearts, by you.

Our gathering now begins on **Wednesday afternoon**, with **Build Day** folded into the experience itself. No separation. No staff. Just a space, some rope, and a growing circle of people making it real.

This is your invitation to be part of the beginning.

### What to Expect

You don't need to be strong. Or skilled. Or organized.  
You just need to show up.

We'll hang lights, set up suspension points, decorate the space, arrange the chill spaces, maybe even rig a secret nook or two. Some will hammer. Some will sweep. Some will make tea and tell stories. All of it counts.

Come early. Arrive Wednesday afternoon if you can.
This is one of the best ways to meet people, soften into the vibe, and become part of the magic *before* it officially begins.

---

## Accommodations

### Sleeping Close

Nights shape us as much as days.
The way we rest, the way we hear each other breathing, the way we wake up into shared light — it all weaves into the story of this gathering.

This isn't about luxury.
It's about proximity. About choosing to be held by a space, and by each other.

### What You'll Find

**🏠 Indoor Accommodations:**
* **Bunk beds indoors** — no tents, no weather worries. Each person gets their own bed and mattress. Bring the bedding that makes you feel safe and soft.
* **Real facilities** — hot showers, indoor toilets, places to brush your teeth, splash water on your face, and return renewed.

**🛏️ Room Options:**
* **Mixed rooms** — for those who like variety
* **FLINTA-only rooms** — for people who are Female, Lesbian, Intersex, Non-binary, Trans, and Agender
* **"Snoring sanctuary"** — for heavy sleepers and their companions

It's simple. But it's real.

### The Atmosphere

Don't expect hotel silence. Expect life.
Whispers between bunks at midnight. Someone brewing tea in the morning for whoever's awake. A soft shuffle of blankets. Occasional laughter, occasional tears.

This is what communal rest feels like. A little messy. Deeply human. Intimate in the most ordinary ways.

Some nights you'll fall asleep faster than you thought. Some nights you'll lie awake, listening to breath, and feel strangely grateful you're not alone.

---

## Food

### The Food Plan

**🍽️ What we provide:**
- **Coffee and water** — always available
- **Bread in the morning** — daily
- **Snacks** — most afternoons  
- **Warm meal** — every evening

**🥗 Dietary choice:**
You'll choose **vegetarian** or **meat** when you register — and we'll ask you to stick with your choice so we can plan portions.

This is *not* a gourmet weekend. But it will be tasty, filling, and made with love (and probably laughter).

# Getting Your Ticket

## Saying Yes (When You Mean It)

A ticket isn't just entry — it's commitment.  
To show up. To co-create. To meet this intensity with presence.

Securing your spot at Bottoms Up! is simple — but we ask that you move slowly. This isn't just about clicking "buy." It's about saying yes, with your whole self.

</div>

<div class="hx-bg-blue-50 dark:hx-bg-blue-900/20 hx-p-6 hx-rounded-lg hx-mb-8">

## Step 1: Read this first

If you've made it to this page, you've probably explored the rest of the site. (If not, we lovingly encourage you to pause and wander back through the other pages.)  

This isn't a spectator gathering. It's immersive. Real. Sometimes beautifully raw.  
We want you to arrive with your eyes wide open — excited, ready, and fully informed about what you're stepping into.

</div>

<div class="hx-bg-green-50 dark:hx-bg-green-900/20 hx-p-6 hx-rounded-lg hx-mb-8">

## Step 2: Reflect Before You Commit

Before you grab a ticket, take a breath.  
Ask yourself:

- Does this call to where I'm at right now?
- Will it nourish me — or stretch me too thin?
- Do I have the capacity (emotionally, physically, financially) to be fully present?

**FOMO is not a good reason to come.**  
You deserve more than that. And so does this space. This gathering asks for your full presence — not your anxious attendance.

Come because it's a yes in your gut.  
Not a maybe in your mind.

</div>

<div class="hx-bg-purple-50 dark:hx-bg-purple-900/20 hx-p-6 hx-rounded-lg hx-mb-8">

## Can't Afford It Right Now?

If money is the only thing standing between you and this experience, please reach out.  
We're open to real conversation — and committed to finding a solution that honors both your needs and ours.

That might mean a sliding scale, a payment plan, work exchange, or creative alternatives.  
No shame. No complicated applications. Just honest conversation and mutual care.

Email us at [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) and let us know what's manageable.  
We'll meet you where we can.

</div>

<div class="hx-bg-gradient-to-r hx-from-rose-50 hx-to-pink-50 dark:hx-from-rose-900/20 dark:hx-to-pink-900/20 hx-p-8 hx-rounded-lg hx-mb-8">

# Unconference: Share Your Gifts

## A Space for Sharing, Not Showing Off

Our unconference is a lightly held container for spontaneous brilliance, shared wisdom, and weird little things you didn't know you needed to talk about.

There's no set schedule. No official "teachers." Just a board, some post-its, and a collective invitation to explore together.

</div>

<div class="hx-bg-gray-50 dark:hx-bg-gray-800/30 hx-p-6 hx-rounded-lg hx-mb-8">

## The Four Unconference Rules

1. **Whoever shows up are the right people.**  
2. **Whatever happens is the only thing that could have.**  
3. **Whenever it starts is the right time.**  
4. **It's over when it's over.**

That's it. That's the magic.

</div>

<div class="hx-bg-indigo-50 dark:hx-bg-indigo-900/20 hx-p-6 hx-rounded-lg hx-mb-8">

## What Might You Offer?

No experts. Just people bringing what's alive.

**What could you bring?**
- A conversation you're hungry to have (e.g., navigating polyamory at gatherings)?
- A skillshare on something you love (e.g., giving a grounding massage, a specific rope technique)?
- A quiet, shared practice (e.g., a guided meditation or an hour of journaling together)?
- A deep dive into a tricky topic (e.g., power dynamics, aftercare, neurodivergence in play)?
- A question or body puzzle you want to explore with others?

We're here for the offbeat, the half-formed, the personal.  
If you care about it, someone else probably does too.

At Bottoms Up!, we tie like no one is watching — because the rope isn't a show. It's a conversation. A confession. A prayer. This isn't about performance. It's about connection. You won't find a lineup, scheduled scenes, or applause cues. But that doesn't mean there's nothing to witness. You'll see beauty here, maybe even brilliance, but it will happen organically — between two people, in the hush of twilight, or the quiet chaos of morning. Ties spun in trust, not for display. Sensation shared without needing an audience.

## Our Philosophy

**Your image is yours.** Your consent to be photographed is sacred.

We take photos to:
- Capture memories for participants
- Document the experience
- Create an archive of our community

We do NOT:
- Post your image online without permission
- Share photos on social media
- Use your image for promotion or commercial purposes
- Allow third-party photography
- Force anyone into frames

**Your body, your image, your choice.**

---

## What Happens With Photos

## Consent-only photography — the rules

- **Ask first, clearly.** Get consent **before** the shot. Name who’s in frame and intended use (personal archive / private share / public post).
- **No bystanders.** No one else in foreground or background. Watch mirrors/windows/reflections.
- **No disturbance.** Keep it brief. No flash, no lights, no tripods. Don’t interrupt scenes, rituals, or shared spaces.
- **Consent is revocable.** A yes can become a no. If anyone asks, **delete immediately** — no debate.
- **Phone Nook.** When you’re not using your device, leave it at the **Phone Nook (charging & storage)**.

### Who Takes Photos?

**Official photographers:** 1–2 designated community members with clear cameras and consent badges

**Personal photos:** Allowed under the consent-only rules above.

**No phones during intimate/ritual moments:** We’ll announce phone-free spaces/times at Opening Circle.

---

### Photo Times

**We announce photo times clearly:**
- Before the Opening Circle
- During afternoon "jam spaces" (optional)
- At the play party
- Other moments as appropriate

**If we're photographing, we'll say so.**

You can:
- Step out of frame
- Say "no photos" to photographers
- Decline specific photos

**It's that simple.**

---

## Privacy & Consent Framework

### Opting Out of Photography

**You can opt out at any time:**

1. **Wear a "no photos" indicator** (badge or armband — provided at check-in)
2. **Tell photographers directly:** "I prefer not to be photographed"
3. **Opt out during consent moment:** We'll ask who opts out; you'll be noted
4. **Tell Consent Crew:** They can spread the word

**Photographers respect these choices immediately.**

---

### Photo Removal

**Changed your mind after the event?**

Email [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) with:
- Your name
- Which photos you want removed
- Brief reason (optional)

We'll delete them within 48 hours. No questions asked. No judgment.

---

### If You're in a Photo You Didn't Consent To

**This is a violation. We take it seriously.**

1. **Report it immediately** to [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) or a Consent Crew member
2. **The photo is removed immediately**
3. **We address it with the photographer**
4. **This is a boundary violation** — we take accountability seriously

---

## Personal Photography

### Can I Bring a Camera?

**Yes, with guidelines:**

**During play spaces:**
- You can bring a camera for personal use
- **Ask first** and get a **yes from everyone** in frame **before** the shot
- **No bystanders** (mind backgrounds, mirrors, reflections)
- **No disturbance** (brief, no flash/lights/tripods; don’t interrupt scenes/rituals)
- If you're playing, put the camera down

**During opening/closing circles:**
- Be present. **Phone-free during the circle itself** (put it away)

**Private moments:**
- Some people don't want to be photographed — **honor that**

**After the shot:** Offer to show it; **delete immediately on request**.
**Where to keep phones:** Use the **Phone Nook** when you’re not actively using your device.

---

### Videography

**Personal video is allowed under the same consent rules as photos.**

Get explicit consent before recording, just like you would for a photo:
- **Ask first, clearly.** Get consent **before** the shot. Name who's in frame and intended use.
- **No bystanders.** No one else in foreground or background. Watch mirrors/windows/reflections.
- **No disturbance.** Keep it brief. Don't interrupt scenes, rituals, or shared spaces.
- **Consent is revocable.** If anyone asks, **delete immediately** — no debate.

Videos can be shared under the same privacy guidelines as photos.

---

## Questions?

**Want to discuss before the event?** Let us know during registration.

## Summary

✅ **Ask first.** Consent before the shot, for everyone in frame.

## What Happens to Photos

**Long-term:**
- Organizers keep an archive for future gatherings

---

## Sharing Photos

### Within Our Community

**You can share photos:**

**You should NOT:**

- Share **only** shots where **every person** consented **before** the photo **and** to **public posting**.  
- **No bystanders.** No faces or identifiable marks without explicit consent.  
- **Anonymize the venue.** Avoid names, wide establishing shots, signage, maps, or time/location details.

**Not sure? Don’t post. Ask us first.**

---

### Public Announcements

**Organizers will:**
- Share event details in advance (marketing, info)
- Use photos only with explicit consent from people in them

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Logistics & Practical

**What's included in my ticket?**
Your ticket (€169) includes access to all activities, shared meals throughout the event, indoor bunk bed accommodation, and use of all facilities (showers, common areas, etc.).

**What are the sleeping arrangements like?**
We provide indoor bunk beds in shared dormitory-style rooms. You'll have your own bed and mattress - just bring your own bedding. Room options include mixed rooms, FLINTA-only rooms, and a "snoring sanctuary" for heavy sleepers.

**Can I attend if I have dietary restrictions?**
Yes! We accommodate vegetarian, vegan, and most dietary restrictions. Please let us know your needs when you register so we can plan accordingly.

**When do tickets go on sale and how much do they cost?**
Tickets go on sale **December 1st at 20:00**. Can't afford the full price? We offer sliding scale options, payment plans, and work exchange. Email us at [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) - no shame, just honest conversation.

### Experience & Community

**Do I need rope experience to attend?**
Not at all. We welcome people at all levels - from complete beginners to experienced practitioners. Curiosity and openness matter more than skill level.

**Is this a session/lab-based learning event?**
This is primarily a community gathering focused on connection and authentic experience. You'll learn through doing and sharing, but it's not structured as traditional sessions.

**What if I don't want to participate in rope?**
That's completely fine. Rope is welcome, not required. Many people come for the community, atmosphere, and other forms of connection and play.

**Can I come alone?**
Absolutely. Many people attend solo. We create structures and spaces that make it easy to connect with others naturally and without pressure.

**What’s the photo policy?**  
**Consent-only.** Take photos only of yourself or people who agreed **before** the shot. **No bystanders. No disturbance. Delete on request.**  
See: [Photography Guidelines](/practical/photography-guidelines) and [Photo Privacy & Sharing](/practical/photo-privacy-sharing).

**What if I feel overwhelmed during the event?**
We have quiet spaces, peer support (FWBs — anyone wearing a bracelet who's available), our trained Consent Crew for boundaries and safety issues, and a culture that honors your right to step back, rest, or leave if needed. Self-care is encouraged, not discouraged.

## Cancellation Policy

### Life happens. We get it.

Sometimes the world shifts. Sometimes you do. Plans change — work emergencies, health scares, heartbreaks, or simply the realization that you need something different right now.

We've built these policies with trust in mind — and trust goes both ways.

### If We Have to Cancel

If Bottoms Up! can't legally take place — due to public-health orders, safety directives, or other force-majeure conditions — we'll cancel the gathering. And if that happens, **you'll get a full refund**.

No hidden fees. No penalties.  
If you paid X euros, we'll return X euros. Simple.

### If You Need to Cancel

We understand that life rarely goes according to plan. If you can't join us for personal reasons — illness, family needs, work changes, or simply recognizing that this isn't the right moment — here are your options:

**Reselling or Gifting Your Ticket**
You're welcome to pass your ticket on — but please check with us first. Here's how it works:

1. **Email us** with your replacement's FetLife name and email
2. **We contact them** to confirm their interest and vibe-check compatibility
3. **We flip the ticket** once they've been approved — simple as that

Every person goes through our gentle vetting process to make sure everyone feels comfortable with the transition.

**Refund Policy**
- **Up to 3 weeks before** (by January 25, 2026): **100% refund**
- **Less than 3 weeks before**: **No refund**, but you can transfer/resell your ticket

We know life is unpredictable. If you're facing genuine hardship or a real emergency, reach out to us directly at [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be). We care about you more than the money.

**For full details on the cancellation process, refund method, and alternatives to cancellation, see: [Cancellation & Refund Policy](/practical/cancellation-policy)**

---

## Photography Guidelines

### This is a private space. That includes your camera roll.

Bottoms Up! is a place where people come to be real — raw, soft, naked, messy, tender, fierce. That kind of openness requires deep trust.

**Core Rule: No photos or videos without explicit consent. Ever.**
That means every person in frame — foreground or background.
Blur is not consent. Assumption is not consent.
**Ask first. Every time.**

For full photography and video guidelines, see: [Photography Guidelines](/practical/photography-guidelines)

### Social Media Guidelines

If you're posting to FetLife, Instagram, or anywhere else:  
- Only share what someone has *clearly agreed to*
- That includes tagging, stories, and vibes  
- Ask before you tag, ask before you post
- Ask even if it feels obvious

We keep most things offline. If you share at all, do it only with explicit consent from everyone visible.

### Venue Privacy

Please:
- Avoid venue names and identifying wide shots when posting
- Crop/blur signage or distinctive features
- Never add time or precise location details

---

## Venue Respect

### The Space Holds Us. Let's Hold It, Too.

Bottoms Up! takes place in a shared, welcoming space — and we want to keep it that way. That means leaving our shared space as we found it. No damage. No burden for someone else to clean up.

We treat the space like we treat each other: with care, with respect, and with attention.

### Respect the Shared Spaces

While we have waste facilities available, we ask everyone to be mindful of the shared indoor environment. That means **being responsible for your own waste and respecting common areas**.

Some tips to make that easy:
- Pack light and leave excess packaging at home
- Bring a small bag for your personal waste
- Use reusable containers and tools whenever you can
- Be mindful of what you consume — it adds up

### Waste Sorting

- **Compostable stuff** (food scraps, paper napkins, etc.): Designated bins on site
- **Recyclables** (clean containers, paper, etc.): Separate collection  
- **General waste**: Keep to minimum, use provided bins
- **Hazardous items** (batteries, etc.): Take with you when you leave

### Clean As You Go

- Clean up after meals and activities
- Put equipment back where you found it
- Report any damage or spills immediately
- Leave shared bathrooms tidy for the next person

We want to show what a kinky gathering can do when it cares.

Leave no mess. Leave beauty instead.

---

## Health & Safety Guidelines

### Before You Arrive

- Please don't attend if you're feeling unwell
- Bring any medications you need
- Let us know about any health conditions that might affect your experience
- Consider your mental/emotional capacity for an intensive community experience

### During the Event

- Stay hydrated and eat regularly
- Get adequate rest between activities
- Check in with yourself regularly about your comfort and capacity
- Ask for help when you need it — that's what community is for

### Consent & Boundaries

- Consent is ongoing and can be withdrawn at any time
- "No" is a complete sentence that needs no explanation
- If someone says no to you, accept it gracefully
- Watch for non-verbal signs of discomfort
- When in doubt, check in verbally
- **Be open with play partners about your state of mind and any substances that may alter it** — this includes alcohol, cannabis, prescription medications, or any other legal or illegal substances that might affect your judgment, perception, or ability to give informed consent

Remember: This isn't just about physical safety, but emotional and energetic well-being too.

## Your Options If You Can't Attend

### Option 1: Resell Your Ticket (Recommended)

**You can resell your ticket to someone else.** This way, your money doesn't disappear — it goes to the new buyer.

**How it works:**
1. **Find a buyer** (friend, community group, WhatsApp community, etc.)
2. **Email us** at [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) with:
   - Your name and order number
   - Their name and email
   - Subject: "Ticket transfer request"
3. **We vet the buyer** (quick check — ensuring they understand the event and values)
4. **Once approved,** the transfer is complete in our system
5. **The buyer pays you directly** (we don't handle the money transfer)

**Why we vet:** We want to protect the community and ensure people arrive with aligned expectations.

**Cost to you:** Free. No processing fee. The buyer reimburses you directly.

---

### Option 2: Defer to Next Year

**You can hold your payment as credit toward 2027.**

- **No refund.**
- **Your €169 credit applies to next year's ticket** (same price, same terms)
- **Email [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be)** with "Deferral request"

---

### Option 3: Wait List Facilitation (If We're Fully Booked)

**If we've sold all 42 tickets and have a waitlist:**

We can add your cancellation to the waitlist pool, and refund the first person who can attend.

**This only works if:**
- We're fully booked (42/42 tickets sold)
- There's an active waitlist

**This doesn't work if:**
- We're not fully booked (your refund just reduces event revenue)
- Your cancellation is within 2 weeks (not enough time to notify waitlist)

---

## Special Circumstances

### Medical or Mental Health Emergency

**Genuine crisis cancellations get compassion:**

1. **Email [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be)** with "Medical emergency cancellation"
2. **Briefly explain** (you don't need to share all details)
3. **We'll discuss:**
   - If we can still facilitate a resale or waitlist refund
   - Deferral to next year (keep your money as credit)
   - Case-by-case exception (rare, but possible)

**We believe in care first.** We won't leave you hanging, but we also can't absorb losses if we're not fully booked.

---

### Family Emergency

Same process as medical emergency.

We understand priorities shift. We'll work with you on what's possible.

---

## How to Transfer Your Ticket

### Step-by-Step Transfer Process

**You can transfer your ticket to another person.**

**How:**
1. **You find the buyer** (friend, community member, etc.)
2. **Email [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be)** with:
   - Subject: "Ticket transfer request"
   - Your name and order number
   - New buyer's name and email
   - Brief note (optional): who they are, how you know them
3. **We vet the transfer** (confirm they understand the event)
4. **Transfer approved:** Buyer's info replaces yours in the system
5. **Buyer makes payment to you** (outside our system)

**Vetting process:**
- We check they understand the event is consent-focused, intimate, and community-based
- We ask 1-2 questions to ensure alignment
- Takes 2-3 days
- If approved, we send confirmation to both of you

**This works any time** (even the week before), as long as we have time to update our records.

---

## Resale Rules

- **You set the price** (we don't control it; that's between you and buyer)
- **You handle payment** (we don't facilitate money transfer)
- **We vet the buyer** (just to protect the community)
- **No processing fee** from us
- **Contact us first** before selling (so we can coordinate vetting)

---

## Questions?

**About resale?** Email [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be)

**Want to defer?** Let us know in your email.

**Emergency situation?** Reach out — we're here to listen and work with you.

## Understanding Consent

### The Short Version?

If it feels like you're selling something — stop.  
If you're working too hard for a "yes," pause. Step back. Try again — or maybe, don't.

A real yes doesn't need convincing.  
Look for the "HELL YES." The "OMG YES."  
Or better yet: the quiet, steady *yes* that lives in the body.

**Trust us — that kind of yes leads to better everything.**

### Celebrate the No

Someone says no?  
Good. That means they trust you enough to be honest.

Say thank you. Mean it.

A "no" is not a rejection — it's a reveal.  
It shows you something real: that this person feels safe enough to voice their boundary.  
That's not a failure of connection — that's the foundation of it.

When someone says no, it proves they're present.  
It proves they're paying attention to what they want — and what they don't.  
And when we receive that no with grace, we show we're worthy of trust.

Every healthy dynamic — sexual, sensual, kinky, or otherwise — is built on the ability to **hear no, hold it, and stay open**.

So don't rush past it. Don't shrink from it. Celebrate it.

Because if someone can say no, it means that when they say yes… they really mean it.

And that's the kind of yes worth waiting for.

### Consent Is a Whole-Body Experience

It's not just a yes or no.  
It's a full-body signal. A living dialogue. A mutual, continuous agreement.

Consent means:
- You're both in it
- You can change your mind at any time
- A yes to one thing is not a yes to everything
- You pay attention — not just to words, but to tone, tension, and body language

### Enthusiastic Consent = Real Consent

> "Consent isn't a question. It's a state.  
> If, instead of lovers, the two of you were synchronized swimmers, consent would be the water.  
> It's not enough to jump in, get wet and climb out —  
> if you want to swim, you have to be in the water continually."  
> — [Yes Means Yes](https://www.yesmeansyes.com/consent/)

We believe sex, kink, and rope all start from this same place: enthusiastic participation where everyone involved genuinely wants to be there.

### Ongoing Consent

Consent is not a one-time agreement. It's a continuous conversation that includes:
- **Check-ins during play** — "How are you feeling?" "What do you need?"
- **Reading non-verbal cues** — body language, breathing, muscle tension
- **Honoring changes** — energy shifts, emotional responses, physical limits
- **Aftercare discussions** — processing what happened, how it felt

### When Things Get Complicated

Sometimes consent gets murky. Sometimes we misread signals or cross lines we didn't know existed. Sometimes we realize mid-scene that we're not as okay as we thought we were.

That's human. That's normal. What matters is how we respond:
- **Stop immediately** when someone says stop
- **Check in regularly** during intense scenes
- **Take responsibility** when you've overstepped
- **Seek support** when you need help processing

## Consent Crew: Your Support Team

### Who We Are

The Consent Crew is a small, dedicated group of individuals trusted by the organization. We are here to serve as a resource for any issues related to consent, boundaries, and conflict resolution. Our role is to listen, offer support, and help facilitate repair when things get difficult.

We are not mediators in a formal sense, but rather a compassionate first point of contact to help you feel heard and find a path forward.

### What We Do

You can approach the Consent Crew for:
- **Navigating a difficult conversation** about boundaries or consent
- Support if you've **experienced a boundary violation**
- Help understanding the **consent framework** of the event
- A **confidential listening ear** if something feels off and you're not sure what to do next
- Follow-up on any reported issues to ensure they are handled with care

### How We're Different from FWBs

**Consent Crew** focuses on consent violations, boundary issues, and conflict resolution. We're here when something has gone wrong or feels unsafe.

**FWBs (Friendly, Welcoming, Buddies)** focus on peer support, emotional wellbeing, and general care. They're here for the everyday navigation of community and connection.

Both are essential parts of our care network, and you can approach whichever feels right for your situation.

### How to Find Us

Consent Crew members will be clearly identified during the opening circle. We'll also have a contact method available (usually a phone number) for anyone who needs to reach us quickly or discretely.

**Remember: You don't need to handle difficult situations alone.** We're here specifically to support you.

## Conscious Care of Our Space

### Care is not just what we do for each other — it's what we do *with* each other.

Bottoms Up! isn't staffed. It's shared. That means the space only holds us as well as **we** hold it.

This isn't about being tidy. It's about being *conscious*.  
Of your body. Your stuff. Your impact. The people beside you.

### The Art of Noticing

You don't need a chore list. Just awareness.

- **Notice what's yours.**  
  If you brought it — take it home. If you used it — clean it. If you dropped it — pick it up.

- **Notice what's off.**  
  If something looks forgotten, lost, or misplaced, take initiative. Straighten it. Stash it. Set it aside safely. You don't need permission to help.

- **Notice the little things.**  
  Wipe a surface. Carry a cup. Return a chair to its place. Small actions ripple.

- **Notice each other.**  
  If someone leaves a trace behind — a cup, a shirt, a tool — offer a gentle reminder. Not judgment. Just care.

### Shared Responsibility

**We all contribute to:**
- Keeping play spaces clean and safe
- Maintaining common areas for everyone's comfort
- Proper disposal of all materials (especially anything bodily)
- Creating an atmosphere of mutual care and respect

**This extends to emotional and energetic care too:**
- Notice when someone seems overwhelmed and needs support
- Help create inclusive, welcoming spaces for newcomers
- Address conflicts or tensions before they escalate
- Hold space for the full range of human emotions and experiences

---

## Safety Guidelines

### Physical Safety

- **Know your limits** and communicate them clearly
- **Start slowly** with new partners or new activities
- **Use safety tools** (rope shears, safety signals, etc.)
- **Stay sober enough** to give and receive consent
- **Stop immediately** if someone says stop or uses a safeword

### Emotional Safety

- **Check in regularly** during and after intense experiences
- **Respect privacy** — not everyone wants their experience shared
- **Hold space** for emotions without trying to fix or minimize them
- **Ask before giving advice** or feedback
- **Honor different processing styles** — some need talk, some need quiet

### Community Safety

- **Speak up** if you witness concerning behavior
- **Support others** in maintaining their boundaries
- **Use our support systems** (Consent Crew, FWBs) when needed
- **Take breaks** when you need them
- **Respect the container** we've created together

Remember: Safety isn't about avoiding all risk — it's about taking conscious, consensual risks with people who care about your wellbeing as much as their own.

## Arriving with Partners

### Arriving Together

You're coming with someone you already share something with.  
That's beautiful.

Maybe it's a long-term partnership.  
Maybe it's new.  
Maybe it's undefined — a rope connection, a playmate, a lover, an anchor.

Whatever shape it takes: you already have some shared language. Maybe some shared history. Maybe shared boundaries.

This page is here to help you **stay grounded in that connection** — while still opening to the space around you.

### About That Bubble

It's natural to stick close when you arrive with someone you trust. Especially in intense, sensual, or unfamiliar spaces.

But intimacy doesn't have to mean insulation.  
And connection doesn't have to mean containment.

We invite you to stay open.
To soften the edges of your "we" — while still opening to the space around you.

> Try orbiting. Try weaving. Try being findable.  
> Let people know how you move: "I'm here with someone — and also open to new energy."

This isn't about splitting up.  
It's about **making room for emergence**.

### Playing Together

Whether you're tying, topping, bottoming, watching, or just breathing in sync:

- **Check in.** Even if it's familiar. Especially if it's familiar. Event energy can stir things up.
- **Tend to the space.** Public play creates atmosphere — be aware of how you're shaping it.
- **Plan for aftercare.** Bring a blanket. Leave space. Make time to land back in each other.

### Playing Separately

Some of you arrive with **non-monogamous agreements**, or **independent playstyles**. Others might discover desires at the event you didn't expect.

We celebrate that.

Some suggestions:
- **Have the awkward conversations early.** Agreements, boundaries, intentions — get clear before you get hot.
- **Don't assume symmetry.** One of you might explore more than the other. That's okay. Move at your own paces with care.
- **Plan for reconnection.** Not just physically. Emotionally, too. Even a 5-minute cuddle check-in can shift everything.

### If Things Get Wobbly

They might. That's not failure — that's reality.

Event energy is raw. Beautiful, but activating. You might feel:
- Protective
- Left out
- Jealous
- Tender
- Surprised by your own reactions

**This is normal.** Here's what helps:

- **Pause before reacting.** Take a breath, find some space, check your emotional state
- **Talk to your person privately.** Don't process in public or through other people
- **Use the support systems.** FWBs can help you sort through unexpected feelings
- **Remember your agreements.** Return to what you decided together before arriving
- **Be gentle with each other.** This intensity can bring up old wounds or new insights

### Relationship Configurations

**Monogamous couples:** You're welcome here whether you play only with each other or not at all. The gathering offers many forms of connection beyond physical play.

**Non-monogamous folks:** Great! Communicate clearly with existing partners and new connections about boundaries and expectations.

**Solo but partnered:** Coming alone while partnered elsewhere requires extra care in communication both directions.

**Single and exploring:** You're not expected to find a partner here, but if connections emerge, navigate them with the same care as everyone else.

**Relationship anarchists:** We love your approach to connection, just be clear about what you're offering and seeking.

And stay open to what's possible.

## Managing Your Baggage

### Before You Cross the Threshold

Every one of us carries stories: heartbreaks, unresolved fights, jealousy, shame, grief, burnout.
That's human. It's also **volatile tinder** in a space like Bottoms Up!—where intensity, intimacy, and erotic charge run high.

Here's the truth:

> **Whatever you bring in—light or dark—will get amplified.**
> If it's wonder, the place will glow.
> If it's unspoken resentment, it can overflow into disruption.

This page is a loving caution. A reminder to **pause, scan, and sort** your inner luggage before you enter the space.

### Name It, Tame It, or Leave It

1. **Name It**  
   - Say it out loud (to yourself, a friend, a journal): *"I'm still angry at X."*  
   - Hidden baggage loves the dark; naming switches on the light.

2. **Tame It**  
   - Do the pre‑work: therapy session, hard conversation, breathwork, long run—whatever helps you find steadiness.  
   - If it can't be fully solved, at least give it a safe container.

3. **Leave It**  
   - Some loads are too fresh, too sharp. That doesn't make you weak—just honest. If the weight feels un‑carry‑able, it might be kinder to sit this gathering out (or arrive later, in a different year).

### Relationship Storms & Drama Triangles

- **Arriving with tension?** Name it together first. Decide: *Pause it, resolve it, or postpone the gathering.*
- **Love triangles & undefined connections?** Get explicit now. Vagueness becomes violence when the energy spikes.  
- **Recent break‑ups?** If seeing this person tie someone else might rip you apart, love yourself enough to wait.

This gathering isn't therapy. It's not neutral ground. It's a **magnifier**.

### Respect the Shared Space

This space holds many bodies, many hearts.
Personal storms can swirl into collective weather.

- **Don't process loudly in public zones.** Find a quiet corner or schedule time off‑site.  
- **Consent to unload.** Ask before dumping heavy feelings on someone who may be tapped out.  
- **Use the support web wisely.** FWBs, Consent Crew, quiet spaces—they're resources, not emotional dumpsters.

### Common Baggage Types

**Recent relationship changes:** Breakups, new relationships, shifting agreements, or major life transitions can all destabilize your emotional ground.

**Unresolved conflicts:** Ongoing tensions with existing partners, friends, or community members will likely surface in intimate spaces.

**Past trauma:** This gathering can trigger unexpected memories or reactions. Come prepared with your coping strategies.

**Shame or insecurity:** About your body, your experience level, your desires, or your worthiness of connection and pleasure.

**Scarcity fears:** Around attention, desirability, or access to the kinds of connections you want.

### Self-Care Strategies

- **Do your emotional homework** before arriving
- **Bring trusted coping mechanisms** (breathing techniques, grounding practices, etc.)
- **Have realistic expectations** about what the gathering can and can't provide
- **Plan for integration time** after the gathering to process what comes up
- **Consider therapy or counseling** support before and after intense experiences

### When to Consider Not Attending

Sometimes the most caring choice is to wait. Consider postponing if:

- You're in acute crisis or trauma recovery
- You have unresolved conflicts with others who will be attending
- Your relationship system is unstable and can't handle additional stress
- You're using the gathering to avoid or escape unaddressed life issues
- You don't have adequate emotional support systems outside the event

This isn't rejection — it's wisdom. The gathering will exist again, and you can arrive when you're more resourced.

### Creating Boundaries

**Before arriving:**
- Identify your emotional, physical, and energetic limits
- Communicate clearly with partners about expectations and agreements
- Make plans for self-care and support during the gathering

**During the gathering:**
- Check in with yourself regularly about your capacity and comfort
- Communicate boundaries clearly and kindly to others
- Ask for what you need without apology or over-explanation
- Say no when something doesn't feel right

**After the gathering:**
- Process the experience with trusted friends or partners
- Notice what came up that might need attention in your regular life
- Integrate insights slowly rather than making major changes immediately

Remember: Boundary-setting is an act of care for both yourself and the community.

Kindly—and courageously—leave it at the door.

## FWBs: Friends With Benefits
*Yes, the good kind.*

At Bottoms Up!, care isn't something the organizers provide.
It's something **we all create** — together, moment by moment.

This year, anyone can be an FWB. And we mean anyone.

### What Is an FWB?

**Friend With Benefits** = someone who's willing to show up for others.  
To hold space. To offer support. To check in. To notice.

Not all the time. Just when you feel able. Just when it's real.

FWBs aren't staff. They're **you**.  
And when you're ready to offer care, you show it by putting on a bracelet.

### How It Works

- **Bracelets = Consent to Care**  
  When you feel grounded and resourced enough to be available for others, slip on a FWB bracelet. That's your quiet signal: "I'm here if you need me."

- **No Pressure, No Performance**  
  You can take it off at any time. There's no expectation to stay "on" all weekend. Your own capacity matters just as much as anyone else's needs.

- **Anyone Can Step In**  
  This isn't a special role. It's a shared one. We all have moments where we can be the calm in the storm — and moments when we can't.

### Why We're Doing It This Way

Because **care can't be outsourced**.  
Because the orga team can't hold it all — and shouldn't.  
Because we believe in shared responsibility, not designated heroes.
**Because we want to see what happens when everyone at the event decides to care for each other.**

This bracelet system lets us flow in and out of service — with consent, clarity, and freedom.

### What FWBs Offer

FWBs are available for:
- **Emotional check-ins** and active listening
- **Grounding support** during overwhelming moments
- **Basic aftercare** — water, snacks, blankets, presence
- **Gentle guidance** for newcomers or anyone feeling lost
- **Conflict de-escalation** and helping people find appropriate resources
- **Just being a friendly face** when you need human connection

Remember: FWBs are peers, not professional counselors. We offer care within our capacity and knowledge, and we help connect people to more specialized support when needed.

## Emotional Wellbeing

### Emotional Safety Matters Just as Much as Physical Safety

Bottoms Up! can stir a lot.
Connection. Intensity. Joy. Tenderness.
And sometimes — disorientation, overwhelm, or loneliness.

Whether it's a hard conversation, a crash after a scene, or just missing the familiar rhythms of home… it's okay. You're not doing it wrong.

### A Few Things That Might Help

- Be gentle with yourself. Take breaks. Drink water. Cry if you need to.  
- Listen to your body — and let it guide your pace.  
- Set your boundaries clearly, and hold them with love.  
- Say no when you need to. Say yes only when it's real.  
- Focus on what feels *right* for you — not what others are doing.  
- Ask for help. Even if it feels awkward. Especially then.

### Common Emotional Experiences

**Drop/Crash**: After intense scenes or connections, you might experience a sudden emotional or energetic low. This is normal. Rest, hydrate, seek gentle company or quiet solitude as needed.

**Overwhelm**: Too much stimulation, too many choices, too much intensity. Find a quiet space, practice breathing, limit sensory input.

**Loneliness in Connection**: Sometimes being around many people can make you feel more alone. This paradox is real and valid. Seek one-on-one connection or comfortable solitude.

**Processing Emotions**: Experiences here can bring up unexpected feelings — old memories, new insights, complicated reactions. Let them move through you rather than trying to fix or analyze them immediately.

### When to Seek Support

Look for someone wearing a **FWB bracelet** when you need:
- A check-in or grounding moment
- Someone to listen without trying to fix
- Help connecting with resources or other support people
- Aftercare support following intense scenes
- Just a friendly presence when you're feeling alone

You can also always approach:
- A trusted friend or fellow participant
- A [Consent Crew member](/wellbeing/consent-safety) — they're the dedicated team for boundaries, repair, or if something feels off  
- The organizing team if you need more structured support

## Neurodivergent Support

### Neurodivergence Is Welcome. So Is Self-Knowing.

Bottoms Up! welcomes the full spectrum of how brains and bodies move through the world.

Autism, ADHD, anxiety, PTSD, sensory sensitivity, dyslexia, executive dysfunction, social burnout, panic loops, self-medication…  
Whatever you're navigating — you're not too much, and you're not alone.

But we'll say this plainly:

**There is no dedicated neuro-support crew.**

There are no therapists, no designated liaisons.
Just a gathering full of people doing their best — including you.

### What That Means

- **You are the expert on your needs.**  
  We trust you to know what helps — and to bring it with you.

- **Support is peer-based and informal.**
  If you're struggling, reach out to someone you trust. That might be a friend, a partner, a fellow attendee.

- **Care flows in all directions.**  
  If you're able to support someone else, beautiful. If not, that's okay too. Don't overextend yourself to meet someone else's regulation needs. You don't have to.

- **The quiet space is open to all.**  
  No forms, no check-ins. Just a soft, low-stim place to decompress if the outside gets too loud.

### Resources We Provide

**Physical Accommodations:**
- Quiet, low-stimulation spaces for decompression
- Clear signage and information about space layouts
- Flexible participation — you can engage at your own level
- Access to basic sensory tools (earplugs, eye masks, fidget items)

**Social Accommodations:**
- No pressure to participate in all activities
- Multiple ways to connect (verbal, non-verbal, structured, unstructured)
- Understanding that social energy is finite and needs to be managed
- FWB support system for gentle peer assistance

**Communication Support:**
- Clear, direct communication about expectations and guidelines
- Written information available for reference
- Permission to ask questions and seek clarification
- Understanding that processing styles vary

### Self-Care Strategies

Bring what you need:
- **Sensory regulation tools** (noise-cancelling headphones, weighted items, textures)
- **Executive function aids** (timers, schedules, reminder systems)
- **Emotional regulation supports** (comfort items, grounding techniques)
- **Communication tools** (scripts for difficult conversations, clear ways to express needs)

Remember: Taking care of your neurodivergent needs isn't selfish — it's how you show up authentically for community and connection.

### A Note on Self-Medication

We understand that many neurodivergent people use various substances (prescription, over-the-counter, or otherwise) to manage symptoms and participate fully in life.

We ask only that you:
- Stay safe and within your known limits
- Remain able to give and receive consent
- Be honest about your capacity for various activities
- Ask for support if your regulation strategies aren't working

We don't police or judge how you manage your neurodivergence. We just want everyone to be able to participate safely and consensually.
