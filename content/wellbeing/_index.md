This camp asks a lot of you — emotionally, energetically, relationally.  
So we’ve built in care. Not just as a safety net, but as a way of being.

These pages are here to support you before, during, and after your time at Rogue Rope Camp.  
Whether you're feeling overwhelmed, excited, cautious, curious — you're not alone. We've thought about you.
