To ensure that everyone at _Rogue Rope Camp_ feels supported and informed, we've organized detailed sections on our website. For those interested in the community dynamics and personal connections, learn more about [FWBs (Friends With Benefits)](/wellbeing/friends-with-benefits). For tailored support, particularly for our neurodiverse attendees, check out our [Neuro-Liaison](/wellbeing/neuro-liaison) services. Understand our [Expectations](/wellbeing/expectations) to help prepare yourself emotionally and mentally. Dive into our guidelines on [Emotional](/wellbeing/emotional) well-being, [Consent](/wellbeing/consent) practices, and [Conscious Care](/wellbeing/conscious-care) approaches that foster a respectful and caring environment. Each section is designed to help you navigate the complexities of interaction and community engagement at the camp.
