# Your Wellbeing Matters

## A Culture of Care

At **Oh Bondage! Up Yours!**, wellbeing isn't an afterthought — it's woven into every aspect of our gathering.

Rope bondage can be intense. Vulnerability can be scary. Growth can be uncomfortable. We know this. Which is why we've built robust support structures to hold you through whatever arises.

## Emotional & Mental Support

### The Care Team
Our dedicated wellbeing facilitators are here for:
- Processing intense emotional experiences
- Navigating interpersonal challenges
- Managing overwhelm or distress
- Integration and sense-making
- Just being a compassionate presence

**You don't need to be in crisis to reach out.** Sometimes you just need someone to listen.

### Self-Care Resources
We provide:
- Quiet spaces for decompression
- Grounding techniques and tools
- Journaling prompts for integration
- Peer support circles
- Scheduled downtime (rest is productive!)

## Physical Safety & Consent

### Consent Culture in Practice
Our approach includes:
- **Pre-Event Communication** — Setting expectations before you arrive
- **Consent Workshops** — Practical skills, not just theory
- **Clear Protocols** — How to negotiate, how to check in, how to say no
- **Enforcement** — Violations are taken seriously and addressed

### Risk Awareness
We teach and practice:
- Physical safety in rope bondage
- Recognizing and responding to distress
- Aftercare practices
- Emergency protocols
- When and how to ask for help

<div class="callout">
  <p class="callout-title">🚨 Important Note</p>
  <p>While we prioritize safety, rope bondage carries inherent risks. We focus on <em>risk awareness and management</em>, not risk elimination. Your participation involves personal responsibility and informed consent.</p>

## Relational Wellbeing

### For People Attending with Partners
Navigating a kink event with a romantic/sexual partner can be complex. We offer:
- Partner check-in frameworks
- Navigating jealousy and insecurity
- Communication tools
- Processing mismatched experiences

### For Solo Attendees
Coming alone can feel vulnerable. We support you through:
- Community building activities
- Partner matching for practice (if desired)
- Solo practice opportunities
- Integration support for unpartnered experiences

### For Everyone
- Navigating new connections and attractions
- Setting and maintaining boundaries
- Processing rejection or disappointment
- Celebrating wins and breakthroughs

## What You Bring Matters

Your wellbeing is a collaboration. We provide structure, support, and safety — but you know yourself best.

**We encourage you to:**
- Know your limits (and communicate them)
- Practice self-advocacy
- Take breaks when needed
- Ask for what you need
- Honor your own pace

**Before you arrive, consider:**
- What support systems do you have back home?
- What self-care practices ground you?
- What are your triggers or sensitivities?
- What does integration look like for you?
