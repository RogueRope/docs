Consent isn’t a question; it’s the water we swim in.

This gathering asks a lot of you — emotionally, energetically, relationally.
So we’ve built in care. Not just as a safety net, but as a way of being.

These pages are here to support you before, during, and after your time at Oh Bondage! Up Yours!.  
Whether you're feeling overwhelmed, excited, cautious, curious — you're not alone. We've thought about you.
