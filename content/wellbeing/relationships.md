## Arriving with Partners

### Arriving Together

You're coming with someone you already share something with.  
That's beautiful.

Maybe it's a long-term partnership.  
Maybe it's new.  
Maybe it's undefined — a rope connection, a playmate, a lover, an anchor.

Whatever shape it takes: you already have some shared language. Maybe some shared history. Maybe shared boundaries.

This page is here to help you **stay grounded in that connection** — while still opening to the space around you.

### About That Bubble

It's natural to stick close when you arrive with someone you trust. Especially in intense, sensual, or unfamiliar spaces.

But intimacy doesn't have to mean insulation.  
And connection doesn't have to mean containment.

We invite you to stay open.
To soften the edges of your "we" — while still opening to the space around you.

> Try orbiting. Try weaving. Try being findable.  
> Let people know how you move: "I'm here with someone — and also open to new energy."

This isn't about splitting up.  
It's about **making room for emergence**.

### Playing Together

Whether you're tying, topping, bottoming, watching, or just breathing in sync:

- **Check in.** Even if it's familiar. Especially if it's familiar. Event energy can stir things up.
- **Tend to the space.** Public play creates atmosphere — be aware of how you're shaping it.
- **Plan for aftercare.** Bring a blanket. Leave space. Make time to land back in each other.

### Playing Separately

Some of you arrive with **non-monogamous agreements**, or **independent playstyles**. Others might discover desires at the event you didn't expect.

We celebrate that.

Some suggestions:
- **Have the awkward conversations early.** Agreements, boundaries, intentions — get clear before you get hot.
- **Don't assume symmetry.** One of you might explore more than the other. That's okay. Move at your own paces with care.
- **Plan for reconnection.** Not just physically. Emotionally, too. Even a 5-minute cuddle check-in can shift everything.

### If Things Get Wobbly

They might. That's not failure — that's reality.

Event energy is raw. Beautiful, but activating. You might feel:
- Protective
- Left out
- Jealous
- Tender
- Surprised by your own reactions

**This is normal.** Here's what helps:

- **Pause before reacting.** Take a breath, find some space, check your emotional state
- **Talk to your person privately.** Don't process in public or through other people
- **Use the support systems.** FWBs can help you sort through unexpected feelings
- **Remember your agreements.** Return to what you decided together before arriving
- **Be gentle with each other.** This intensity can bring up old wounds or new insights

### Relationship Configurations

**Monogamous couples:** You're welcome here whether you play only with each other or not at all. The gathering offers many forms of connection beyond physical play.

**Non-monogamous folks:** Great! Communicate clearly with existing partners and new connections about boundaries and expectations.

**Solo but partnered:** Coming alone while partnered elsewhere requires extra care in communication both directions.

**Single and exploring:** You're not expected to find a partner here, but if connections emerge, navigate them with the same care as everyone else.

**Relationship anarchists:** We love your approach to connection, just be clear about what you're offering and seeking.

And stay open to what's possible.

## Managing Your Baggage

### Before You Cross the Threshold

Every one of us carries stories: heartbreaks, unresolved fights, jealousy, shame, grief, burnout.
That's human. It's also **volatile tinder** in a space like Bottoms Up!—where intensity, intimacy, and erotic charge run high.

Here's the truth:

> **Whatever you bring in—light or dark—will get amplified.**
> If it's wonder, the place will glow.
> If it's unspoken resentment, it can overflow into disruption.

This page is a loving caution. A reminder to **pause, scan, and sort** your inner luggage before you enter the space.

### Name It, Tame It, or Leave It

1. **Name It**  
   - Say it out loud (to yourself, a friend, a journal): *"I'm still angry at X."*  
   - Hidden baggage loves the dark; naming switches on the light.

2. **Tame It**  
   - Do the pre‑work: therapy session, hard conversation, breathwork, long run—whatever helps you find steadiness.  
   - If it can't be fully solved, at least give it a safe container.

3. **Leave It**  
   - Some loads are too fresh, too sharp. That doesn't make you weak—just honest. If the weight feels un‑carry‑able, it might be kinder to sit this gathering out (or arrive later, in a different year).

### Relationship Storms & Drama Triangles

- **Arriving with tension?** Name it together first. Decide: *Pause it, resolve it, or postpone the gathering.*
- **Love triangles & undefined connections?** Get explicit now. Vagueness becomes violence when the energy spikes.  
- **Recent break‑ups?** If seeing this person tie someone else might rip you apart, love yourself enough to wait.

This gathering isn't therapy. It's not neutral ground. It's a **magnifier**.

### Respect the Shared Space

This space holds many bodies, many hearts.
Personal storms can swirl into collective weather.

- **Don't process loudly in public zones.** Find a quiet corner or schedule time off‑site.  
- **Consent to unload.** Ask before dumping heavy feelings on someone who may be tapped out.  
- **Use the support web wisely.** FWBs, Consent Crew, quiet spaces—they're resources, not emotional dumpsters.

### Common Baggage Types

**Recent relationship changes:** Breakups, new relationships, shifting agreements, or major life transitions can all destabilize your emotional ground.

**Unresolved conflicts:** Ongoing tensions with existing partners, friends, or community members will likely surface in intimate spaces.

**Past trauma:** This gathering can trigger unexpected memories or reactions. Come prepared with your coping strategies.

**Shame or insecurity:** About your body, your experience level, your desires, or your worthiness of connection and pleasure.

**Scarcity fears:** Around attention, desirability, or access to the kinds of connections you want.

### Self-Care Strategies

- **Do your emotional homework** before arriving
- **Bring trusted coping mechanisms** (breathing techniques, grounding practices, etc.)
- **Have realistic expectations** about what the gathering can and can't provide
- **Plan for integration time** after the gathering to process what comes up
- **Consider therapy or counseling** support before and after intense experiences

### When to Consider Not Attending

Sometimes the most caring choice is to wait. Consider postponing if:

- You're in acute crisis or trauma recovery
- You have unresolved conflicts with others who will be attending
- Your relationship system is unstable and can't handle additional stress
- You're using the gathering to avoid or escape unaddressed life issues
- You don't have adequate emotional support systems outside the event

This isn't rejection — it's wisdom. The gathering will exist again, and you can arrive when you're more resourced.

### Creating Boundaries

**Before arriving:**
- Identify your emotional, physical, and energetic limits
- Communicate clearly with partners about expectations and agreements
- Make plans for self-care and support during the gathering

**During the gathering:**
- Check in with yourself regularly about your capacity and comfort
- Communicate boundaries clearly and kindly to others
- Ask for what you need without apology or over-explanation
- Say no when something doesn't feel right

**After the gathering:**
- Process the experience with trusted friends or partners
- Notice what came up that might need attention in your regular life
- Integrate insights slowly rather than making major changes immediately

Remember: Boundary-setting is an act of care for both yourself and the community.

Kindly—and courageously—leave it at the door.
