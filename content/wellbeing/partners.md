### Arriving Together

You’re coming with someone you already share something with.  
That’s beautiful.

Maybe it’s a long-term partnership.  
Maybe it’s new.  
Maybe it’s undefined — a rope connection, a playmate, a lover, an anchor.

Whatever shape it takes: you already have some shared language. Maybe some shared history. Maybe shared boundaries.

This page is here to help you **stay grounded in that connection** — while still opening to the field around you.

### About That Bubble

It’s natural to stick close when you arrive with someone you trust. Especially in intense, sensual, or unfamiliar spaces.

But intimacy doesn’t have to mean insulation.  
And connection doesn’t have to mean containment.

We invite you to stay open.  
To soften the edges of your “we” — without losing what makes it special.

> Try orbiting. Try weaving. Try being findable.  
> Let people know how you move: “I’m here with someone — and also open to new energy.”

This isn’t about splitting up.  
It’s about **making room for emergence**.

### Playing Together

Whether you're tying, topping, bottoming, watching, or just breathing in sync:

- **Check in.** Even if it’s familiar. Especially if it’s familiar. Camp energy can stir things up.
- **Tend to the field.** Public play creates atmosphere — be aware of how you're shaping it.
- **Plan for aftercare.** Bring a blanket. Leave space. Make time to land back in each other.

### Playing Separately

Some of you arrive with **non-monogamous agreements**, or **independent playstyles**. Others might discover desires at camp you didn’t expect.

We celebrate that.

Some suggestions:
- **Have the awkward conversations early.** Agreements, boundaries, intentions — get clear before you get hot.
- **Don’t assume symmetry.** One of you might explore more than the other. That’s okay. Move at your own paces with care.
- **Plan for reconnection.** Not just physically. Emotionally, too. Even a 5-minute cuddle check-in can shift everything.

### If Things Get Wobbly

They might. That’s not failure — that’s reality.

Camp energy is raw. Beautiful, but activating. You might feel:
- Protective
- Left out
- Jealous
- Tender
- Surprised by your own reactions

Let that be okay.  
Feelings aren’t threats — they’re data. Check in. Breathe. Come back to curiosity.

If you need support, reach out — you don’t have to hold it all alone:

- [FWBs](/wellbeing/fwb) aren’t staff or professionals — they’re fellow campers who’ve chosen to show up with presence and care when they feel resourced. Look for someone wearing a bracelet.
- The Consent Crew is here to help with trickier situations — boundaries, mediation, or navigating consent conversations.
- There are quiet spaces on site if you need to step away, breathe, cry, stretch, or just be.

Support here doesn’t follow a chain of command.  
It follows a chain of compassion.  
Use it.

### Helpful Practices

- **Name your needs.** Out loud. Early. Kindly.
- **Check in daily.** Morning coffee or end-of-day recaps work wonders.
- **Make room for both togetherness and spaciousness.** Trust that you can stretch without breaking.

### This Place Welcomes You — All of You

You don’t have to fit a model.  
You don’t have to explain your dynamic.  
But you are invited to arrive with presence and openness.

Whether you move as a couple, a trio, a constellation, or a vibe — we ask this:

> **Let your bond be a root — not a wall.**

Protect what’s sacred.  
And stay open to what’s possible.
