At _Rope Camp_, we warmly welcome individuals with diverse neurological backgrounds and strive to accommodate their unique needs as effectively as possible. We recognize and support a wide range of neurodiversities, including but not limited to autism spectrum disorders, ADHD, PTSD, dyslexia, Tourette's Syndrome, and those who experience anxiety or depression. We also acknowledge and support participants who choose self-medication as part of managing their conditions.

### Empowerment and Self-Reliance at the Camp:

- **Self-Management:** We encourage all participants to take proactive steps in managing their individual needs. This includes maintaining routines that support your well-being, managing your medication responsibly, and preparing strategies to cope with the dynamic festival environment.

- **Communication of Needs:** If comfortable, communicate your specific needs and preferences to our dedicated neuro-volunteers. They are here not only to assist but to empower you in making your experience as inclusive and enjoyable as possible.
  
- **Volunteer Opportunities:** If you’re passionate about advocacy and would like to support others while also fostering your own skills, consider volunteering as a mental health support person or neuro-liaison. 

- **Designated Quiet Space:** Recognizing the need for personal space, we offer a designated quiet area on site. This space is designed to be a retreat for those who need a moment away from the crowd, providing a peaceful environment to regroup and recharge.

- **Self-Responsibility and Safety:** At _Rope Camp_, we promote a balance of support and self-sufficiency. All participants are expected to manage their needs in a way that ensures their own safety and the safety of others. This includes thoughtful management of personal medication and ensuring that self-medication practices do not negatively impact the wider community.

- **Community Respect and Interaction:** We foster a culture of mutual respect and mindfulness. Each participant is asked to be considerate of how their actions may affect others, maintaining clear communication and respecting personal boundaries at all times.

- **Resource Accessibility:** Should you need assistance or resources, our volunteers and staff members are equipped and ready to help. We encourage you to reach out for support when needed, as part of managing your self-reliance effectively.

We hope that _Rope Camp_ serves as a platform for personal growth, empowerment, and joy. It’s an opportunity for everyone to engage, learn, and support one another in creating a supportive and inclusive environment.
