### Care is not just what we do for each other —  
it’s what we do *with* each other.

Rogue Rope Camp isn’t staffed. It’s shared. That means the space only holds us as well as **we** hold it.

This isn’t about being tidy.  
It’s about being *conscious*.  
Of your body. Your stuff. Your impact. The people beside you.

## The Art of Noticing

You don’t need a chore list. Just awareness.

- **Notice what’s yours.**  
  If you brought it — take it home. If you used it — clean it. If you dropped it — pick it up.

- **Notice what’s off.**  
  If something looks forgotten, lost, or misplaced, take initiative. Straighten it. Stash it. Set it aside safely. You don’t need permission to help.

- **Notice the little things.**  
  Wipe a surface. Carry a cup. Return a chair to its place. Small actions ripple.

- **Notice each other.**  
  If someone leaves a trace behind — a cup, a shirt, a tool — offer a gentle reminder. Not judgment. Just care.

## We Are the Care Crew

You don’t have to be a cleaner to care.  
You don’t have to be a “helper” to help.  

Care isn’t a task — it’s a way of being in relationship with space, self, and others.

Let’s leave every room better than we found it.  
Let’s make our messes part of the magic.  
Let’s take responsibility for what we touch, use, open, move, spill, or stir.

That’s the kind of kink we’re into.

**Care is contagious. Let’s start the ripple.**
