## Understanding Consent

### The Short Version?

If it feels like you're selling something — stop.  
If you're working too hard for a "yes," pause. Step back. Try again — or maybe, don't.

A real yes doesn't need convincing.  
Look for the "HELL YES." The "OMG YES."  
Or better yet: the quiet, steady *yes* that lives in the body.

**Trust us — that kind of yes leads to better everything.**

### Celebrate the No

Someone says no?  
Good. That means they trust you enough to be honest.

Say thank you. Mean it.

A "no" is not a rejection — it's a reveal.  
It shows you something real: that this person feels safe enough to voice their boundary.  
That's not a failure of connection — that's the foundation of it.

When someone says no, it proves they're present.  
It proves they're paying attention to what they want — and what they don't.  
And when we receive that no with grace, we show we're worthy of trust.

Every healthy dynamic — sexual, sensual, kinky, or otherwise — is built on the ability to **hear no, hold it, and stay open**.

So don't rush past it. Don't shrink from it. Celebrate it.

Because if someone can say no, it means that when they say yes… they really mean it.

And that's the kind of yes worth waiting for.

### Consent Is a Whole-Body Experience

It's not just a yes or no.  
It's a full-body signal. A living dialogue. A mutual, continuous agreement.

Consent means:
- You're both in it
- You can change your mind at any time
- A yes to one thing is not a yes to everything
- You pay attention — not just to words, but to tone, tension, and body language

### Enthusiastic Consent = Real Consent

> "Consent isn't a question. It's a state.  
> If, instead of lovers, the two of you were synchronized swimmers, consent would be the water.  
> It's not enough to jump in, get wet and climb out —  
> if you want to swim, you have to be in the water continually."  
> — [Yes Means Yes](https://www.yesmeansyes.com/consent/)

We believe sex, kink, and rope all start from this same place: enthusiastic participation where everyone involved genuinely wants to be there.

### Ongoing Consent

Consent is not a one-time agreement. It's a continuous conversation that includes:
- **Check-ins during play** — "How are you feeling?" "What do you need?"
- **Reading non-verbal cues** — body language, breathing, muscle tension
- **Honoring changes** — energy shifts, emotional responses, physical limits
- **Aftercare discussions** — processing what happened, how it felt

### When Things Get Complicated

Sometimes consent gets murky. Sometimes we misread signals or cross lines we didn't know existed. Sometimes we realize mid-scene that we're not as okay as we thought we were.

That's human. That's normal. What matters is how we respond:
- **Stop immediately** when someone says stop
- **Check in regularly** during intense scenes
- **Take responsibility** when you've overstepped
- **Seek support** when you need help processing

## Consent Crew: Your Support Team

### Who We Are

The Consent Crew is a small, dedicated group of individuals trusted by the organization. We are here to serve as a resource for any issues related to consent, boundaries, and conflict resolution. Our role is to listen, offer support, and help facilitate repair when things get difficult.

We are not mediators in a formal sense, but rather a compassionate first point of contact to help you feel heard and find a path forward.

### What We Do

You can approach the Consent Crew for:
- **Navigating a difficult conversation** about boundaries or consent
- Support if you've **experienced a boundary violation**
- Help understanding the **consent framework** of the event
- A **confidential listening ear** if something feels off and you're not sure what to do next
- Follow-up on any reported issues to ensure they are handled with care

### How We're Different from FWBs

**Consent Crew** focuses on consent violations, boundary issues, and conflict resolution. We're here when something has gone wrong or feels unsafe.

**FWBs (Friendly, Welcoming, Buddies)** focus on peer support, emotional wellbeing, and general care. They're here for the everyday navigation of community and connection.

Both are essential parts of our care network, and you can approach whichever feels right for your situation.

### How to Find Us

Consent Crew members will be clearly identified during the opening circle. We'll also have a contact method available (usually a phone number) for anyone who needs to reach us quickly or discretely.

**Remember: You don't need to handle difficult situations alone.** We're here specifically to support you.

## Conscious Care of Our Space

### Care is not just what we do for each other — it's what we do *with* each other.

Bottoms Up! isn't staffed. It's shared. That means the space only holds us as well as **we** hold it.

This isn't about being tidy. It's about being *conscious*.  
Of your body. Your stuff. Your impact. The people beside you.

### The Art of Noticing

You don't need a chore list. Just awareness.

- **Notice what's yours.**  
  If you brought it — take it home. If you used it — clean it. If you dropped it — pick it up.

- **Notice what's off.**  
  If something looks forgotten, lost, or misplaced, take initiative. Straighten it. Stash it. Set it aside safely. You don't need permission to help.

- **Notice the little things.**  
  Wipe a surface. Carry a cup. Return a chair to its place. Small actions ripple.

- **Notice each other.**  
  If someone leaves a trace behind — a cup, a shirt, a tool — offer a gentle reminder. Not judgment. Just care.

### Shared Responsibility

**We all contribute to:**
- Keeping play spaces clean and safe
- Maintaining common areas for everyone's comfort
- Proper disposal of all materials (especially anything bodily)
- Creating an atmosphere of mutual care and respect

**This extends to emotional and energetic care too:**
- Notice when someone seems overwhelmed and needs support
- Help create inclusive, welcoming spaces for newcomers
- Address conflicts or tensions before they escalate
- Hold space for the full range of human emotions and experiences

## Safety Guidelines

### Physical Safety

- **Know your limits** and communicate them clearly
- **Start slowly** with new partners or new activities
- **Use safety tools** (rope shears, safety signals, etc.)
- **Stay sober enough** to give and receive consent
- **Stop immediately** if someone says stop or uses a safeword

### Emotional Safety

- **Check in regularly** during and after intense experiences
- **Respect privacy** — not everyone wants their experience shared
- **Hold space** for emotions without trying to fix or minimize them
- **Ask before giving advice** or feedback
- **Honor different processing styles** — some need talk, some need quiet

### Community Safety

- **Speak up** if you witness concerning behavior
- **Support others** in maintaining their boundaries
- **Use our support systems** (Consent Crew, FWBs) when needed
- **Take breaks** when you need them
- **Respect the container** we've created together

Remember: Safety isn't about avoiding all risk — it's about taking conscious, consensual risks with people who care about your wellbeing as much as their own.
