### Emotional Safety Matters Just as Much as Physical Safety

Rogue Rope Camp can stir a lot.  
Connection. Intensity. Joy. Tenderness.  
And sometimes — disorientation, overwhelm, or loneliness.

Whether it’s a hard conversation, a crash after a scene, or just missing the familiar rhythms of home… it’s okay. You’re not doing it wrong.

### A Few Things That Might Help

- Be gentle with yourself. Take breaks. Drink water. Cry if you need to.  
- Listen to your body — and let it guide your pace.  
- Set your boundaries clearly, and hold them with love.  
- Say no when you need to. Say yes only when it’s real.  
- Focus on what feels *right* for you — not what others are doing.  
- Ask for help. Even if it feels awkward. Especially then.

### If You Need Support — Look for a Bracelet

Care here isn’t assigned. It’s shared.

When someone wears a **FWB bracelet**, it means they’re open to holding space — for a check-in, a grounding moment, a quiet sit under the trees. When you feel strong enough to care for others, you can wear one too.

You can also always approach:

- A trusted friend or campmate  
- A Consent Crew member — they’re here for boundaries, repair, or if something feels off  
- Or just someone who looks like they might get it — we’re all learning to read each other, gently

### You Won’t Be Judged Here

If something feels off — we don’t rush to blame or label.  
We look for what can help.  
Sometimes that’s a conversation. Sometimes it’s a hug and a snack. Sometimes it’s space.

We’ll figure it out together.

This place is intense because it’s real.  
And real things take courage.

Let yourself be soft here, too.
