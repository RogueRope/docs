### Emotional Safety Matters Just as Much as Physical Safety

Rogue Rope Camp can stir a lot.  
Connection. Intensity. Joy. Tenderness.  
And sometimes — disorientation, overwhelm, or loneliness.

Whether it’s a hard conversation, a crash after a scene, or just missing the familiar rhythms of home… it’s okay. You’re not doing it wrong.

### A Few Things That Might Help

- Be gentle with yourself. Take breaks. Drink water. Cry if you need to.
- Listen to your body — and let it guide your pace.
- Set your boundaries clearly, and hold them with love.
- Say no when you need to. Say yes only when it’s real.
- Focus on what feels *right* for you — not what others are doing.
- Ask for help. Even if it feels awkward. Especially then.

### If You Need Support — We’re Here

We’ve built in care. Not just as backup, but as an ethic.

If you’re struggling, confused, overstimulated, or just need someone to sit with — reach out. There are people here who want to help.

You can always approach:

- **A trusted friend or peer** — sometimes a familiar face is the best medicine.
- **The Consent Crew** — they’re here for more than just crisis. Boundaries, weird vibes, repair conversations — they’ve got you.
- **The Neuro-Liaison** — for those who process the world a little differently, or need support navigating the noise.

### You Won’t Be Judged Here

If something feels off — we don’t rush to blame or label.  
We look for what can help.  
Sometimes that’s a conversation. Sometimes it’s a hug and a snack. Sometimes it’s space.

We’ll figure it out together.

This place is intense because it’s real.  
And real things take courage.

Let yourself be soft here, too.
