# Friends With Benefits  
_Yes, the good kind._

At Rogue Rope Camp, care isn’t something the organizers provide.  
It’s something **we all create** — together, moment by moment.

This year, anyone can be an FWB. And we mean anyone.

---

## What Is an FWB?

**Friend With Benefits** = someone who’s willing to show up for others.  
To hold space. To offer support. To check in. To notice.

Not all the time. Just when you feel able. Just when it’s real.

FWBs aren’t staff. They’re **you**.  
And when you’re ready to offer care, you show it by putting on a bracelet.

---

## How It Works

- **Bracelets = Consent to Care**  
  When you feel grounded and resourced enough to be available for others, slip on a FWB bracelet. That’s your quiet signal: “I’m here if you need me.”

- **No Pressure, No Performance**  
  You can take it off at any time. There’s no expectation to stay “on” all weekend. Your own capacity matters just as much as anyone else’s needs.

- **Anyone Can Step In**  
  This isn’t a special role. It’s a shared one. We all have moments where we can be the calm in the storm — and moments when we can’t.

---

## Why We’re Doing It This Way

Because **care can’t be outsourced**.  
Because the orga team can’t hold it all — and shouldn’t.  
Because we believe in shared responsibility, not designated heroes.  
**Because we want to see what happens when a whole camp decides to care for each other.**

This bracelet system lets us flow in and out of service — with consent, clarity, and freedom.

## When You Might Reach for an FWB

- You’re feeling wobbly and need grounding  
- You need help navigating a tricky emotional moment  
- You’re not sure who to talk to about something that feels off  
- You just need someone to walk with for a minute

FWBs aren’t therapists or security. They’re fellow campers.  
If more support is needed, they’ll help connect you with Consent Crew or orga.

## This Is How We Care

We’re not building a support team.  
We’re building a **support culture**.

And it starts with trust — that you’ll step up when you can, and step back when you can’t.  
That someone will see you. That someone will stay.

So if it feels right, slip on the bracelet.  
And if you need care? Look for one glowing on someone’s wrist.

We’ve got each other.  
That’s what makes this camp work.
