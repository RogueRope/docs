# Our Valued FWBs

At the core of our collective care system are our FWBs â€“ Friends With Benefits, who volunteer to ensure everyone's wellbeing, safety, and comfort throughout the event. Their commitment is pivotal to the enriching experience we all cherish.

## First Aid Support

If you find yourself with a minor injury, our trained FWBs are at your service, operating on a tiered support system:

1. **Self-Care:** Make use of the communal first aid kits for treating simple injuries.
2. **Peer Support:** Look to your companions for immediate aid or a calming presence.
3. **FWB Assistance:** Our identifiable FWBs stand ready for when you need that extra level of care.

## Consent Crew

Our Consent Crew FWBs are dedicated to upholding a culture of consent, providing assistance, and facilitating mediation to ensure everyone's boundaries are respected.

## Neuro-Liaison

Our Neuro-Liaison FWBs offer specialized support to neurodiverse members of our community, helping to navigate the event comfortably and mediate any issues that may arise.
