### The Short Version?

If it feels like you’re selling something — stop.  
If you’re working too hard for a “yes,”  
pause.  
Step back.  
Try again — or maybe, don’t.

A real yes doesn’t need convincing.  
Look for the “HELL YES.” The “OMG YES.”  
Or better yet: the quiet, steady *yes* that lives in the body.

**Trust us — that kind of yes leads to better everything.**

### Celebrate the No

Someone says no?  
Good. That means they trust you enough to be honest.

Say thank you.  
Mean it.

### Consent Is a Whole-Body Experience

It’s not just a yes or no.  
It’s a full-body signal. A living dialogue. A mutual, continuous agreement.

Consent means:
- You’re both in it.
- You can change your mind at any time.
- A yes to one thing is not a yes to everything.
- You pay attention — not just to words, but to tone, tension, and body language.

### Enthusiastic Consent = Real Consent

> “Consent isn’t a question. It’s a state.  
> If, instead of lovers, the two of you were synchronized swimmers, consent would be the water.  
> It’s not enough to jump in, get wet and climb out —  
> if you want to swim, you have to be in the water continually.”  
> — [Yes Means Yes](https://www.yesmeansyes.com/consent/)

We believe sex, kink, and rope all start from this same place:  
A *shared*, excited, embodied yes.  
The kind that moves you both.

### If Something’s Off — Tell Us

If someone on the “going” list is raising red flags, if you’ve had an issue with someone, or if you’ve witnessed behavior that concerns you — **please let us know.**

You can:
- Message us via FetLife
- Use [this contact form]({{< ref "/contact" >}} "Contact us")

Tell us what happened. If you have ideas for how we could hold it — boundaries, support, checking in — include those too.

We’ll listen. We’ll think.

No system is perfect. But we’re committed to holding these things well.
