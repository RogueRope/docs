### Who We Are

The Consent Crew is a small, dedicated group of individuals trusted by the organization. We are here to serve as a resource for any issues related to consent, boundaries, and conflict resolution. Our role is to listen, offer support, and help facilitate repair when things get difficult.

We are not mediators in a formal sense, but rather a compassionate first point of contact to help you feel heard and find a path forward.

### What We Do

You can approach the Consent Crew for:
- **Navigating a difficult conversation** about boundaries or consent.
- Support if you've **experienced a boundary violation**.
- Help understanding the **consent framework** of the event.
- A **confidential listening ear** if something feels off and you're not sure what to do next.
- Follow-up on any reported issues to ensure they are handled with care.

### How We're Different from FWBs

The support structure at Oh Bondage! Up Yours! has a few different layers, each with a unique role:

- **FWBs (Friends With Benefits):** This is our peer-to-peer support network. FWBs are fellow participants offering general emotional support, a grounding presence, or a quiet conversation when they have the capacity. They are your first stop for feeling wobbly or needing a friendly face.
- **Consent Crew:** We are a more specialized team. While FWBs offer broad peer support, the Consent Crew is specifically focused on issues of consent and interpersonal conflict. We have been chosen by the organizers for this role and act as a dedicated resource for these sensitive situations.
- **Organizers:** The organizing team holds the overall logistics and structure of the event. You would talk to them about practical matters like food, accommodations, or the schedule.

### How to Find Us

The members of the Consent Crew will be personally introduced during the **Opening Circle** at the beginning of the event. We will make sure you know who we are and how to find us throughout the weekend.

If you need support, you can always ask an FWB or an organizer to help you locate a member of the Consent Crew.
