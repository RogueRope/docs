While we are not in the open air, the essence of caring for our shared space remains paramount. Let’s foster an environment of mutual respect and cleanliness. If you see something out of place or forgotten, take the lead and tidy up. 

Be that friendly reminder for someone who might have overlooked their belongings.  

## Your Part in Keeping Our Space Neat

Everything you bring into our event has a place, and when it's not in its place, it's up to us to remedy that. We're all adults here, so let's:

- **Be Responsible:** Keep track of your belongings and waste. If you brought it, make sure it leaves with you.
- **Take Initiative:** If you notice unattended items or waste, don't wait for others. Act responsibly and place it in the proper location.
- **Clean As You Go:** Incorporate tidiness into your activities. Cleaning up immediately means less work later.
- **Help the Forgetful:** Remind others gently if they've left something behind. Sometimes, a friendly nudge is all it takes.

We might not be your caregivers, but let’s embody the ethos of being a community that cares—for the space and for each other.
