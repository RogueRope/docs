### Intro

Rogue Rope Camp is back.

If you were with us last time — welcome home.  
If this is your first — take a deep breath.  
You’re in the right place.

The core is the same: rope as ritual.  
Connection over performance.  
Consent as a way of being.

But this year, we’re stretching further — into more time, more space, more softness, more shadow.  
We’ve added a day. Slowed the pace. Built in more room to land.

This isn’t a festival.  
It’s a gathering. Of the brave. Of the curious.  
A space where eros is invited — never expected.  
Where rope is welcome — but never required.  
Where your longing has room to speak — and be heard.

Come to tie.  
Come to be tied.  
Come to find something you don’t have words for yet.

Bring your story.  
Bring your body.

Let’s see what happens when we meet without masks.
