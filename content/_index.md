## New here? Welcome.

If you've been with us before — welcome back to the warmth of connection.
If this is your first gathering — breathe deep. You're exactly where you need to be.

This isn't a gathering for spectators. It's a sanctuary. For the curious. For the brave enough to be vulnerable. A space where desire whispers — never demands. Where rope is an invitation — never an obligation.

Five days to shed the rush. To sink into something slower, softer, more essential.

Come to tie. Come to surrender. Come to discover what lives in the spaces between.
