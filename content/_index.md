### Intro

Rogue Rope Camp is back. If you were with us last time — welcome home. If this is your first, take a deep breath. You’re in the right place.

We’re holding the same core: rope as ritual, connection over performance, consent as a way of being. But we’re stretching further this year — into more time, more space, more softness, more shadow. We’ve added a day. Slowed the pace. Built in more room to land.

This isn’t a festival. It’s a gathering of the brave and the curious. A space where eros is invited, not expected. Where rope is welcome, but never required. Where your longing has room to speak — and be heard.

Whether you come to tie, to be tied, or to find something you don’t have words for yet, you’re welcome here.

Bring your story. Bring your body. Let’s see what happens when we meet without masks.
