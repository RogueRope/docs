### Intro

Winter is coming. And with it, Oh Bondage! Up Yours!

If you've been with us before — welcome back to the warmth.  
If this is your first winter gathering — breathe deep the cold air.  
You're exactly where you need to be.

The essence remains unchanged: rope as ritual.  
Connection over performance.  
Consent as sacred practice.

But this winter, we're diving deeper — into intimacy, into stillness, into the quiet spaces between breaths.  
Four days to shed the rush. To sink into something slower, softer, more essential.

This isn't a festival.  
It's a sanctuary. For the curious. For the brave enough to be vulnerable.  
A space where desire whispers — never demands.  
Where rope is an invitation — never an obligation.  
Where your authentic self has room to emerge — and be witnessed.

Come to tie.  
Come to surrender.  
Come to discover what lives in the spaces between.

Bring your hunger.  
Bring your tenderness.

Let's see what unfolds when we gather close against the cold.
