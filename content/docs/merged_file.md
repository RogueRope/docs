**This is the short summary right here:** if it takes effort to convince someone to do something, if you feel like a salesperson of cellphone subscriptions: stop, pause, turn around and walk away. Don't settle for a "yes", go for the "HELL YES!", the "FUCK YES!" or at least the "OMG YES!". Trust us, you'll thank yourself later.

[Here's a video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqBQH1e7XwQ "Enthusiastic Consent!")

Also: learn to be thankful for a "no". This means the person feels fine with expressing their wants and needs. Thank them for their honesty and openness.

Consent is a **whole-body experience**. It is not just a verbal “yes” or “no” – it involves paying attention to your partner as a person and checking in with physical and emotional cues as well.

Consent is also **mutual** (both people have to agree) and must be **continuous**. You can stop at any time, you can change your mind, and just because you said yes to one thing doesn’t mean you have consented to anything else.

## Consent is Enthusiastic

From [Project Respect](https://www.yesmeansyes.com/consent/) We believe that everyone has the right to sexuality without violence and hence we believe that positive sexuality begins with **enthusiastic consent**. This means being as excited and into someone else’s enjoyment as we are excited and into our own enjoyment. Only yes means yes – and yes should come from an engaged and enthusiastic partner.

> “Consent isn’t a question. It’s a state. If, instead of lovers, the two of you were synchronized swimmers, consent would be the water. It’s not enough to jump in, get wet and climb out - if you want to swim, you have to be in the water continually. And if you want to have sex, you have to be continually in a state of enthusiastic consent with your partner.”

**Consent** and open communication are key to positive sexual experiences for everyone involved.

## Let us know! 

**Please**, if you have had issues with someone, seen red flags or witnessed inappropriate behavior of someone on the ‘going-list’, **let us know**.
You can use Fetlife messages or [contact the orga]({{< ref "/docs/practical/contact" >}} "Contact us") in some other way.
Feel free to use a pseudonymous account by creating a new mail address with protonmail/yahoo/fastmail/… 

Please describe the issues and propose a way for us to deal with them. Does this person need someone to work with them on their behavior? Could we assist in facilitating [restorative justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice)? Can they still attend but do we need to keep an eye on them? Can they attend if they promise not to interact with you? Or is the best solution for them not to attend the event?

We will assess the situation and try to think of the best solution, after which we will contact you to see if this solution works for you. No process is perfect, but we’ll try to find something that works for all involved parties.

While we are not in the open air, the essence of caring for our shared space remains paramount. Let’s foster an environment of mutual respect and cleanliness. If you see something out of place or forgotten, take the lead and tidy up. Be that friendly reminder for someone who might have overlooked their belongings.

## Your Part in Keeping Our Space Neat

Everything you bring into our event has a place, and when it's not in its place, it's up to us to remedy that. We're all adults here, so let's:

- **Be Responsible:** Keep track of your belongings and waste. If you brought it, make sure it leaves with you.
- **Take Initiative:** If you notice unattended items or waste, don't wait for others. Act responsibly and place it in the proper location.
- **Clean As You Go:** Incorporate tidiness into your activities. Cleaning up immediately means less work later.
- **Help the Forgetful:** Remind others gently if they've left something behind. Sometimes, a friendly nudge is all it takes.

We might not be your caregivers, but let’s embody the ethos of being a community that cares—for the space and for each other.

## Guidelines for a Tidy Event

- **Contain Your Waste:** Always have a small bag on hand to collect your trash.
- **Monitor the Bins:** If a bin is full, notify an organizer. Don’t let overflow become an issue.

Together, let's ensure that our gathering is remembered not just for the vibrant encounters but also for the collective respect we show to our surroundings.

# Unconference

Four easy rules for unconference sessions

* Rule one: Whoever shows up are the right people.
* Rule two: Whatever happens is the only thing that could have.
* Rule three: Whenever it starts is the right time.
* The fourth and final rule is: It’s over when it’s over.

## Think ahead

Now, let's think ahead and prepare for our sessions! We'll be using the classical un-conference format with post-it notes. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

What topics or subjects would you like to see covered or learn more about? We want to make sure we're addressing the needs and interests of our event.
Are there any topics, subjects, workshops, or activities that you'd like to share with others? We believe in peer exchange and want to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their knowledge and expertise.

And here's a tip: there's no need to fall back on the teacher-student paradigm. We encourage peer exchange and want everyone to feel empowered to contribute in their own unique way.

Our content team will announce the sessions in advance, so you'll have plenty of time to prepare and think about what you'd like to discuss or share. We're excited to see what amazing ideas and insights come out of our unconference sessions!

The essence of our rope journey **transcends the stage**. As we embrace the spirit of "[Tie like no one is watching]({{< ref "/docs/main/manifesto" >}} "Tie like no one is watching")", we invite you to experience rope as a medium for connection rather than performance.

This year at Rogue Rope, we celebrate **the spontaneous, the intuitive, and the deeply personal voyages** embarked upon through the ties that bind not just bodies, but hearts and souls. We honor each individual's path, whether as a rigger or a bottom, cherishing the beauty and strength found in surrender and trust.

**Forget the stage, the lights, and the audience.** Instead, we're curating moments of joy, encounters that may not be performances but are spectacles in their own right. The rope is our conduit to new situations, new connections, and the shared experiences that come from genuine, heartfelt encounters.

So, while you won't find a schedule of performances, you'll discover something more profound — a series of rope encounters designed to break the ice and initiate the first steps towards making a connection. There is nothing to perform, but so much to see and experience.

If you're moved to share your journey with rope, our content coordinators are here to facilitate these encounters. We're ready to assist you with any setups or spaces you may need to explore your rope narrative in the company of others.

In lieu of performances, **witness the myriad of personal stories unfolding around you**. Participate, engage, and let the rope guide you to new friendships and unforgettable moments. The stage is gone, but the space for connection is vast and welcoming. Come, let's weave new stories together at Rogue Rope.

### Intro

Welcome to the inaugural indoor edition of _Bottoms Up!_, where we delve deep into the sensory and emotional journey of the bottom in rope. While our summer camps have been a playground under the open skies, this winter **we bring the magic indoors**. The essence remains: to learn, play, and nurture our rope events.

At Bottoms Up!, we’ve taken care of **the basics**: a spacious indoor venue to host our events, bunk beds for a cozy night’s sleep, and of course, the ropes and suspension points for our central theme. Add to this mix a sound system for ambiance, and basic amenities for comfort.

But, as always, it’s the heartbeats of all participants that elevate this gathering to its true potential. Whether you’re sharing insights in our unconference, tying or getting tied, or simply being present in the moment, **your presence and energy** are what will make these days memorable.

This event may present an **intense experience** and might not be everyone’s cup of tea. It’s crucial for attendees to align with the ethos and intent behind Bottoms Up!. However, **if you’re keen to explore, connect, and contribute**, we’re excited to welcome you.

What sets _Bottoms Up!_ apart is our **unique approach**. We are **not** about accumulating new knowledge through workshops; instead, our focus is on utilizing the knowledge that participants already possess to create **profound experiences**. It’s about bringing your personal understanding of rope into a shared space where **skills become a means to facilitate deeper human connection**. Bring your experience, your openness, and let’s weave together moments that not only last for the days we’re together but linger in our memories, our senses, and our bonds.

Thank you for your interest in _Bottoms Up!_ We’re eager to embark on this new journey with our cherished friends. **Together, let’s craft an event that resonates, connects, and celebrates the depth of the bottom’s journey in rope.**

# The "Tie Like No One's Watching" Manifesto

At the heart of our gathering, we cherish the ties that bind n**ot just bodies, but hearts and souls**. "Tie like no one is watching" embodies the intimate essence of our rope journey. It is an invitation to engage with rope not as a performance for onlookers, but as a medium for deep, personal connection.

Rope becomes our language; it weaves stories of silent dialogues, emotional confessions, and the tender interplay of trust and vulnerability. While technical skills and workshops are valuable, they serve as mere starting points. The true art of rope lies in the **spontaneous moments, the intuitive touches, and the personal voyages** we embark upon with our partners.

Our space is a sanctuary for all — a place where every individual, regardless of background or gender identity, can forge meaningful connections. We honor the path of the bottom with the same reverence as the rigger, acknowledging the beauty and strength in surrender and trust.

Sometimes there's a pull towards the conventional, a lure of the '**knowledge exchange**' where passively listening gives an illusion of productivity, of being busy in a beneficial way. But let's ponder – **how much do we truly retain from days of intense workshops**? Often, it feels like productivity porn, a hustle to feel we're gaining, learning, advancing. 

Yet, this path can sometimes lead to a misguided equation: rope = workshops. If that's the sum total, **we're missing the point**.

Knowledge sharing has its place, sure, but **what people crave is connection, experiences**. _Bottoms Up!_ aligns with the practices we've nurtured – no high-profile tutors on posters, no separate billing. Everyone is a participant, an equal part of the whole.

![network.](/images/distributed.jpeg)

**What we aim for is to create an environment where people encounter new situations, fostering connections through these shared experiences. We're not selling workshops or peddling knowledge – we're curating moments of joy. The rope is merely a conduit.**

We envision a series of rope encounters, **experiences designed to break the ic**e, to initiate those first, often daunting, steps towards making a connection. Everyone talks a big game, but the reality is that making that initial contact is a universal struggle, despite the fact that we all come to these events seeking connection.

**Let's focus on that – the genuine, heartfelt encounters that happen when people come together, bound by rope.**---

## Inclusive Rope Revelry

At the heart of our gathering is rope play, an open invitation to all who wish to explore the intricate art of Shibari, regardless of skill level. The event's design is a nod to this central theme.

We’re dismantling the myth that expertise is required to join the Rogue Rope soirees. You don’t need to be adept at rope to dive in—curiosity and enthusiasm are the only prerequisites. Whether you're content with the basics, eager to expand your repertoire, or seek a watchful eye as you venture into new techniques, you’re in the right place.

Newcomers are as celebrated as the seasoned; every journey begins with a single knot.

Competition has no place here—our ties are not for triumph, but for connection.

## A Spectrum of Sensations

* Variety spices up the playground: whips, canes, chains, needles, even fire—all expressions of play are welcome here.
* We honor the bare and the bold. Nudity and sexuality are not shrouded but embraced, an integral aspect of our vibrant tapestry.

## Zoned for Comfort

* To cater to the diverse preferences and comfort levels of our attendees, we’ve thoughtfully designated different zones within our space.
* Each zone serves as a unique atmosphere, ranging from quiet and contemplative spaces to more dynamic and interactive areas.
* Participants can navigate through these zones, finding their own comfort within the boundaries that feel right for them, ensuring a safe, consensual, and enjoyable experience for everyone.

Not sure what you can do? **Don't worry!** At _Bottoms Up!_, every participant is a valuable member of the group. We believe that the event is what we all make of it - together. Whether you're full of ideas or just full of energy, your contribution is welcome here. Everyone pitches in here in their own unique way, during, before, or after the event. It's about spirit more than skill, camaraderie more than capability.

We embrace every effort, big or small, and cherish the diversity of contributions. **There is no competition here; some may contribute more than others, and that's perfectly okay.** We understand that everyone has their own rhythm and capacity for productivity. Also, sometimes contributions that others do aren't so noticeable. Please be kind and respectful, **do your thing,** and appreciate that others may be in a different space or pace.

## Everyone Can Contribute

Think you're not an artist or builder? **Think again!** Contribution comes in countless forms. Share a recipe, a song, a dance. Teach a class, offer a listening ear, or organize a game. Even a smile can be a masterpiece at Bottoms Up!

Remember to **extend kindness** to one another in our collective endeavors. **It's not about how much or how little one contributes** but the heart and respect we bring to the community. Encourage and support your fellow participants without judgment or comparison.

Remember, this event is a canvas, and you're the artist. Whether your passion lies in culinary arts, wellness, entertainment, education, or anything in between, there's a space for your expression here.

## Together, We Are Bottoms Up!

Your involvement is what transforms __Bottoms Up!_ from an event to an experience. It's a co-created adventure that blossoms with each person's touch. So what will your touch be? A workshop? A performance? A piece of art? A comforting space? Whatever it is, bring it along!

Come with an open heart and leave with a soul full of memories and connections. At Bottoms Up!, every hand helps, every idea matters, and every participant makes a difference. Let's co-create the extraordinary, with kindness as our guide.

**Never film or photograph someone without their explicit consent.** This includes people in the background of a photo you're taking.

If you have a dispute with someone about photography, please let the organizer know. Your right to take someone’s photo and publish it **never** over-rules their right to privacy! If posting photos onto FetLife or other social networking sites, **MAKE 100% SURE** that **EVERYONE** featured in your photos is happy for them to be posted. You should not be tagging people online unless you have their explicit permission to do so.

If you have any questions about photography or filming at our winter event, please [contact the orga]({{< ref "/docs/practical/contact" >}} "Contact us").

## Do NOT Post Pictures of the Site!

Please do not publish identifiable pictures of the location. We want to keep using the site the coming years. The site provides us with privacy, and we should be able to return the favor. The site did not consent to being photographed and published, so just don't.  Take this into account when taking a picture, but particularly when posting online. Feel free to take pics of the site for personal use.

If you want to make a picture of someone where identifiable parts are in the background, feel free to do so, but just don't publish them. Take extra care in regards to social media, you might think it's fun to have a pseudo-anonymous Insta, FB, YouTube or Twitter account, but when you publish a picture, often more is uploaded than you might assume.

Gone are the days of camping in the open field – this winter, we're moving indoors. Our event will feature dormitory-style sleeping arrangements, equipped with sturdy bunk beds for a restful night's sleep after a day of connection and exploration.

We offer differentiated sleeping quarters to cater to various needs, including FLINTA (women, lesbians, inter, non-binary, trans, agender) and snoring rooms, ensuring comfort and consideration for all attendees.

**Accommodation Highlights:**

* **Budget-friendly Hostel Feel**: Get the full festival experience with the comfort of being indoors, perfect for the chilly winter months.
* **Bunk Beds**: Cozy up in your own bunk, complete with a mattress. Just remember to bring your own bedding or sleeping bag.
* **Mixed, FLINTA and Snoring Rooms**: Choose a room that suits your comfort, whether it's a quieter space or one that accommodates snoring.
* **Community Atmosphere**: Our shared spaces promote interaction and connection, even when you're winding down for the day.

**Additional Information:**

* **Indoor Facilities**: We've got the essentials covered with indoor toilets and showers – no porta-potties here!
* **Electricity Access**: Charge your devices conveniently indoors, but remember, energy-hungry appliances are a no-go.
* **Respect the Space**: Treat our dorms with care so everyone can enjoy a pleasant stay.
* **Mindful Smoking**: Designated outside smoking areas are available for those who wish to indulge.

**What to Bring:**

* **Bedding**: A sleeping bag, blankets, your own bed linens a a pillow for the bunk beds.
* **Personal Essentials**: Toiletries, towels, and anything else you'd need for a comfortable hostel stay.

**Please Note:**

The indoor space is limited, so while we encourage you to bring your personal touch, we ask that you keep the shared areas clutter-free. We're all in this together, creating a harmonious and enjoyable environment for our winter journey.---

# Food

## What's the general idea?

No need to bring a cooler this year! We have refrigerators available for storing your personal food items.

Each morning, we'll gather for a communal brunch. We'll provide the bread, coffee, and tea. Anything else you'd like on your bread, bring along and store it in our refrigerators to keep it fresh. If you need to purchase additional groceries, supermarkets are conveniently located within 2 km.

In the afternoon, we'll offer a light snack, such as hummus, salad, or ice cream. For dinner, we'll serve a warm meal, typically featuring a BBQ and the ever-popular frites-mobile.

While the camp provides basic sustenance, it's not an all-day buffet. So, if you enjoy cornflakes in the morning or like to snack throughout the day, bring your favorite munchies, nuts, granola bars, fruit, or chocolate bars. Customize your camp experience to your liking!

As a new addition this year, we'll have bread available throughout the day. Feel free to make yourself a sandwich whenever you please.

We offer **vegetarian** and **meat** options. When you sign up for a ticket, you will be asked to indicate your preference. Please note that to make the logistics of the menus work, you will need to stick with your choice.

Anything beyond vegetarian or meat diets is not within our current kitchen capacity. If you have very specific nutrition needs \(vegan, gluten-free, organic\), we are open to helping you, and can provide those with specific needs access to the kitchen. [Get in touch]({{< ref "/docs/practical/contact" >}} "Contact us") and we'll work something out.

As you can see, this is **not** a culinary event, but we're confident that, with your help, we can make this work. So, prepare your taste buds for some nice surprises.


## Summary : What to Bring Yourself?
* Snacks and treats (also to share).
* Your own drinks and sodas. Please note there will be **no bar** on site.
* As with drinks, provide your own favorite bread covering (cheese/meat/jam/vegan spread or even pindakaas)

The stage is set for an unforgettable event, but before the journey of exploration begins, we have a day of creation - our Build Day!

This isn't a one-person show; it’s a collective symphony. From the early hours, we're inviting as many hands as possible to help construct the backdrop for our winter experience. We’ve left behind the concept of PreCamp to focus on a dedicated Build Day where every moment counts.

This call is for the crafty, the willing, and the spirited. Your skillset, whether it's wielding a drill or weaving a vision into reality, is invaluable. The tasks vary, ensuring there’s a place for every talent. And remember, this is more than just preparation; it’s the first stroke of our shared canvas.

Here’s the twist: becoming a part of Build Day is not just about giving but also receiving. You'll forge connections, soak in the pre-event energy, and leave your personal imprint on the event's very foundation.

If you’re eager to contribute to something larger than life, mark your calendar and join us in laying the groundwork for an epic winter edition of _Bottoms Up!_ To sign up, simply fill out our [Build Day form](https://forms.gle/R7ptCx6uXLiy5F7c9) with your availability. Let's make this more than an event; let’s make it our collective masterpiece.

## Cancellation

If the event is not legal under Belgian or local laws (due to Covid waves/Putin/...), it shall not take place. In this case, everyone will receive a **full refund** for all costs \(tickets, drink vouchers\). No hidden fees will be deducted. If you paid X euros, we'll send you your X euros back via bank transfer.


## Personal Cancellation

If you can't attend for personal reasons \(sickness, change of plans, ... \) you can resell or gift your tickets. In this case, let the organizers know, so we can vet the person you want to sell your ticket to. Every participant needs to be confirmed by the orga. There is no point in selling your ticket to someone who won't be allowed to participate. So first, send an email to the orga, with your friend's FetLife name and email. We will send you both an email with instructions on how to proceed.
If you don't know anyone to take your ticket off your hands, and we have people on the waiting list, you can get a refund of 90% of the ticket price. If we don't have people on the waiting list, we can't make any refund promises but we will do our best to cut you a deal. Also in this case [contact the orga]({{< ref "/docs/practical/contact" >}} "Contact us").

## Orga Cancellation

In case something happens that forces us to cancel the camp, you will get a full refund.

## Early Termination of the Event

If the event has started but has to be terminated early, due to harsh weather, acts of nature or other conditions beyond our control, the ticket price is not refundable.
