## Being Together: Our Shared Agreements

**We made a few agreements to keep this space honest, safe, and kind.**

- **Consent comes first, always.** Get it clearly, give it freely, and tune in to words and silence. Be grateful when someone trusts you with their truth.
- **Respect the humans around you.** Every person here carries a story. Be mindful, be curious, ask before touching, and honor pronouns.
- **Speak what's real.** Say what you mean and hear what's said. When things feel tender, choose clarity as a form of care.
- **Stay present.** Let the outside world wait. Be here with your body, your breath, and your attention.
- **Own your impact.** We all fuck up; what matters is what you do next. Apologize, repair, learn, and grow.
- **Play with awareness.** Kink, sex, and BDSM are welcome here, but never at the cost of safety or consent. Know your edges, respect others', and be gentle with power.
- **Take care of yourself.** Eat, hydrate, rest, and ask for what you need. You're not here to push through—you're here to be whole.

### Generosity as Love in Action

**Be generous.**  
Offer what you can: your time, your skills, your mischief, your warmth.

What counts as participation? All of it.

- Chopping onions
- Hanging lights
- Tidying the space
- Holding someone who needs to cry
- Tying rope, sharing a song, offering your favorite snack at 3am

There is no competition here. No one gets a gold star. Contribution looks different for everyone — and that's the point.

Whether you're a helper, a dreamer, a mischief-maker, or someone who simply holds the energy of care in a space... you belong.
