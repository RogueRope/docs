## The Heart of It

Rope is our shared language — but what matters most isn't technique. It's presence, honesty, and how we meet one another.

In the pages below you'll find what makes Bottoms Up! different: the philosophy, the lived experience, and the agreements that hold it all.

### Core Understanding

- [**Our Philosophy**](/docs/concept/philosophy) — The gentle rebellion that guides everything we do. Connection over performance. Ritual over technique.
- [**What Happens**](/docs/concept/experience) — The ceremonies, rhythms, and structures that shape our five days together
- [**Our Shared Agreements**](/docs/concept/agreements) — How we commit to keeping our space honest, safe, and kind

### Finding Your Place

- [**Is This For You?**](/docs/concept/is-this-for-you) — Self-reflection for newcomers considering the gathering
- [**Belonging**](/docs/concept/belonging) — How we create space for everyone to feel at home

### Deeper Context

- [**Sex-Positive Space**](/docs/concept/sex-positive) — How we hold sexuality, desire, and erotic energy
- [**Post-Rope**](/docs/concept/post-rope) — The philosophy beyond technique and performance
