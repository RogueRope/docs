## We Are One of the Very Few

Most rope events sanitize sexuality. They keep eros at arm's length, treat desire as a side effect rather than the point, frame sexual expression as something to manage rather than celebrate.

Bottoms Up! is not most events.

We are **explicitly, unapologetically sex-positive**. And that's rare in the shibari world.

---

## What Sex-Positive Means (For Us)

**Not:** Porn-centric performance, exploitation, male-gaze spectacle, pressure to be sexual, crude or fetishy stereotypes.

**Yes:** Desire is sacred. Sexuality is part of our humanity. Eros belongs alongside rope, intimacy, and presence. People can express their sexuality—or choose not to—without apology.

Sex-positive means:

- Desire is normal, worthy, and beautiful
- Sexuality is diverse (some people want sex; some want intimacy; some want neither; all valid)
- Consent makes it ethical
- Mystery and sensuality matter more than explicitness
- We don't separate the body from the spirit

## Why It Matters

Most rope communities are built by and for people who had to hide their sexuality to stay safe. Rope was refuge—a place where desire could exist, but quietly. Gratefully. Apologetically.

We've inherited that caution.

But something shifts when we stop apologizing for desire. When we say openly: **Yes, sexuality is part of what we practice here. Yes, people will kiss, touch, make love, express pleasure. Yes, nudity happens. Yes, we light candles and we also light fire.**

That shift creates permission. Room. Freedom.

If you've been told your desire is too much, too weird, too kinky, too queer, too anything—this space says: **Not here. Here, your hunger is welcome.**

## How Sexuality Shows Up

**At the gathering, you might see:**

- People kissing during rope scenes
- Sensual touching that's sexual or sacred (sometimes both)
- Naked bodies being bound, touched, witnessed
- Scenes that are foreplay, lovemaking, or something with no name
- Pleasure. Sounds of pleasure.
- Intimacy that's tender, fierce, slow, urgent, playful, solemn

**You won't see:**

- Pressure to perform
- Objectification
- Spectacle for its own sake
- Exploitation

**You will feel:**

- Presence
- Consent
- Reverence for bodies and desire
- The sacred in the sensual

## The Distinction We Make

We're **not** a sex party. We're not a porn set. We're not a place where sexuality is the entertainment for voyeurs.

We're a space where people can explore sexuality **with dignity, presence, and care**. Where desire is woven into rope, into ritual, into connection.

Sex can be:

- A spiritual practice
- An expression of power and vulnerability
- A form of intimacy
- A way to be fully alive in your body
- Joyful, tender, intense, playful, sacred

All of this is welcome. And so is NOT participating. Your sexuality is yours—to express, to explore, or to keep private.

---

## Permission You Might Need

If you've been told:

**"You're too sexual for rope"** — You're not. Your desire is part of what makes rope alive.

**"That's not what shibari is supposed to be"** — This is what it can be when we stop gatekeeping.

**"Nice people don't talk about sex"** — We're not nice. We're real. Real includes desire.

**"I'm not brave enough to want this"** — Bravery isn't required. Just curiosity. Just honesty.

**"I'll be judged for my sexuality"** — Not here. We celebrate the full spectrum—from asexual to hypersexual and everything in between.

---

## Why This Matters for Rope

Rope is a language of vulnerability and power. Sexuality is where vulnerability gets most real, power most potent, truth most naked.

When we bind someone, we're asking: _Can you trust me with your body? With your desire? With your truth?_

That trust is erotic. It's also sacred. Both things at once.

Trying to do rope without acknowledging sexuality is like trying to do rope while pretending bodies don't exist. You're hiding the most important part.

We don't hide. We celebrate.

---

## What This Means for You

You can:

- Bring your full sexuality
- Express desire without apology
- Explore pleasure with a partner
- Watch others without judgment
- Sit quietly with your own desire
- Choose not to participate sexually
- Change your mind mid-gathering
- Have sex, or not have sex, or something else entirely

**You cannot:**

- Violate someone's consent
- Pressure anyone into sexuality
- Detach from presence (sex as performance is not welcome)
- Treat bodies as objects

---

## We're Building Something Different

Most rope communities exist in the margins, grateful for the space, not pushing back against the culture that says desire should be hidden.

We're building something different: a community where sexuality is named, honored, celebrated. Where you don't have to choose between being kinky and being respectable. Where desire and reverence live in the same moment.

This is rare.

That's why you're here.

---

## Come If...

- You want to explore sexuality in community, safely, with consent
- You're ready to witness others' desire without judgment
- You're curious about what rope becomes when we stop apologizing for eros
- You want permission to bring your whole self—including your sexuality
- You're hungry for a space that celebrates bodies, pleasure, and power

**Come as you are. Desire and all.**
