## What We're Really After

Let's not pretend it's about rope alone.
Let's name what it really is: **a longing to be met**.

Most of us don't struggle with what we want. We struggle with how to begin. That first moment — the glance, the ask, the touch — can feel like the hardest one. So we build bridges. We create gentle rituals and open invitations that help people find their way to one another.

At Bottoms Up!, you won't leave with a certificate.
You might leave changed.

## Tie Like No One Is Watching

At Bottoms Up!, we cherish the ties that bind — not just bodies, but hearts and breath, shadow and light. "Tie like no one is watching" isn't a performance note. It's an invitation to drop the mask. To meet through rope, not just with hands, but with honesty.

## The Essence of Rope

Rope is a language. One of tension, stillness, surrender. It doesn't need applause. It doesn't need perfection. It needs presence.

Skill helps, sure. But the real magic lives in what can't be taught — those quiet, electric moments where something shifts between you.

Without eros, rope is just knots. With it, it becomes a ritual of longing and play and truth.

## Beyond the Workshop Mindset

It's tempting to chase knowledge. To fill a schedule, collect techniques, feel productive. But we've seen it: the hunger isn't really for more information. It's for connection. For experiences that linger.

The kind that don't come from sitting in a circle taking notes — they come from being brave enough to reach out.

**This isn't about downloading information.**
**It's about transformation.**

We don't chase productivity. We don't sell certainty. What we're building is a community of risk-takers and tenderness-makers. People who want to feel more, not just know more.

## Designed for Serendipity

We design for encounters that might not happen unless we make space for them. This isn't a lineup of scheduled classes. It's a curated field of possibilities — moments of shared joy, awkward first hellos, spontaneous knots that turn into friendships.

The setting changes everything. You feel it when the atmosphere envelops your scene. When you move with intention in shared space. When rope becomes the bridge between souls in this carefully held container.

Here, we let go of the studio rules. We create suspension from within. The space becomes part of the play — intimate, alive, and endlessly welcoming.

---

## Embracing Eros and Inclusivity

We don't shy away from desire. We invite it.

Bottoms Up! is a sex-positive space: sexuality is neither hidden nor required, and eros sits alongside rope, intimacy, and care. Bodies, hunger, and reverence all belong here.

This is a space for all bodies, all backgrounds, all orientations. We honor the rigger and the bottom equally — not as roles to perform, but as people to witness.

Rope isn't a hierarchy. It's a dance of trust, in whatever form it takes.

Come if you're ready for something real.
Come if you're craving something deeply connective.
Come if you want to feel rope not just on your skin — but in your soul.
