## Who Belongs Here

This is a space for many.
But not for all.

Bottoms Up! welcomes queerness, neurodivergence, kink, softness, weirdness, and everything else that doesn't fit neatly into polite society. We hold space for shadow and play, for bodies that don't match expectations, for desires that don't ask permission.

We want you here if you come with curiosity.
We want you here if you long for honesty, connection, or the freedom to be as you are.
We want you here if you're ready to meet others with care, and to be met in return.

But let's be clear:

This is not a place for entitlement, for ego, or for domination without consent.
It's not a place for people who won't respect boundaries.
It's not a place for those unwilling to take responsibility for their impact.

If you're here to connect — for real — you're welcome.
If you're here to control, consume, or detach, you're not.

### Access Is Not the Same as Entitlement

We do our best to make this space financially and physically accessible.
**If money is the barrier, reach out.** We're ready to talk and find something that works.

Maybe that's a discount.
Maybe installments.
Maybe a trade.

We don't do shame. We do dialogue.

But access is a _shared responsibility_.
You still need to show up with presence. To tend to yourself and the people around you. To be ready for the intensity this space brings.

If you're not sure you're ready — that's okay.
Better to pause than to force it.

### The Intensity Is Real

This isn't a light weekend.
It's immersive. Emotional. Sensory. Beautiful — and intense.

Some people stay the whole time. Some leave early. Both are valid.

We support pacing and self-care. We encourage reflection before you say yes:
Are you in a place to give and receive in community?
To risk being seen as you are?

This space will hold you — if you also hold it.
