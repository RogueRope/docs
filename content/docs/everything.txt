# Unconference

Four easy rules for unconference sessions

* Rule one: Whoever shows up are the right people.
* Rule two: Whatever happens is the only thing that could have.
* Rule three: Whenever it starts is the right time.
* The fourth and final rule is: It’s over when it’s over.

## Think ahead

Now, let's think ahead and prepare for our sessions! We'll be using the classical un-conference format with post-it notes. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

What topics or subjects would you like to see covered or learn more about? We want to make sure we're addressing the needs and interests of our community.
Are there any topics, subjects, workshops, or activities that you'd like to share with others? We believe in peer exchange and want to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their knowledge and expertise.

And here's a tip: there's no need to fall back on the teacher-student paradigm. We encourage peer exchange and want everyone to feel empowered to contribute in their own unique way.

Our content team will announce the sessions in advance, so you'll have plenty of time to prepare and think about what you'd like to discuss or share. We're excited to see what amazing ideas and insights come out of our unconference sessions!

Welcome to the stage, dear friends! As Shakespeare once said, "All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players." So, we invite you to step up and showcase your incredible talents, whether they're related to rope or not.

Are you a spoken word poet with a message to share? A dancer ready to take the floor and move us with your grace? Or maybe you're a magician with a few tricks up your sleeve, and a bunny in your hat? Whatever it is that makes you unique, we want to see it!

At Rogue Rope, we celebrate individuality and creativity, and we want to give you the opportunity to express your amazing talents. Take center stage and delight us all with your performances.

Please let our content coordinators at the camp know if you're interested in performing. Keep in mind that our shows may take place outdoors, adding an extra layer of magic to your performance. If you require music, bring your MP3 files on a thumb drive or provide a Spotify playlist. And don't worry, if you need any assistance, just reach out to us in advance, and we'll be happy to help.

So, the stage is set, and we're eagerly waiting for you to take it. Come and share your passions with us, and let's create unforgettable memories together.

**Never film or photograph someone without their explicit consent.** This includes people in the background of a photo you're taking.

If you have a dispute with someone about photography, please let the organizer know. Your right to take someone’s photo and publish it **never** over-rules their right to privacy! If posting photos onto FetLife or other social networking sites, **MAKE 100% SURE** that **EVERYONE** featured in your photos is happy for them to be posted. You should not be tagging people online unless you have their explicit permission to do so.

If you have any questions about photography or filming at Rogue Rope Camp, please [contact the orga]({{< ref "/docs/main/contact" >}} "Contact us").

## Do NOT Post Pictures of the Campsite!

Please do not publish identifiable pictures of the location. This includes the building, certain signs or plaques, etc... A tree isn't recognizable, the building, signs and interior spaces are. 
We want to keep using the site the coming years. Therefore, we ask you to not burn our location. The site provides us with privacy, and we should be able to return the favor. The site did not consent to being photographed and published, so just don't.  Take this into account when taking a picture, but particularly when posting online. Feel free to take pics of the site for personal use.

If we spot a picture that clearly shows where the event took place, we will spank your bottom and ask you to edit it or take it down. This **includes** photos posted on FetLife.

If you want to make a picture of someone where identifiable parts are in the background, feel free to do so, but just don't publish them. Take extra care in regards to social media, you might think it's fun to have a pseudo-anonymous Insta, FB, YouTube or Twitter account, but when you publish a picture, often more is uploaded than you might assume.

## Can I Fly my Drone at Rogue Rope Camp?

**This is the short summary right here:** if it takes effort to convince someone to do something, if you feel like a salesperson of cellphone subscriptions: stop, pause, turn around and walk away. Don't settle for a "yes", go for the "HELL YES!", the "FUCK YES!" or at least the "OMG YES!". Trust us, you'll thank yourself later.

[Here's a video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqBQH1e7XwQ "Enthusiastic Consent!")

Also: learn to be thankful for a "no". This means the person feels fine with expressing their wants and needs. Thank them for their honesty and openness.

Consent is a **whole-body experience**. It is not just a verbal “yes” or “no” – it involves paying attention to your partner as a person and checking in with physical and emotional cues as well.

Consent is also **mutual** (both people have to agree) and must be **continuous**. You can stop at any time, you can change your mind, and just because you said yes to one thing doesn’t mean you have consented to anything else.

## Consent is Enthusiastic

From [Project Respect](https://www.yesmeansyes.com/consent/) We believe that everyone has the right to sexuality without violence and hence we believe that positive sexuality begins with **enthusiastic consent**. This means being as excited and into someone else’s enjoyment as we are excited and into our own enjoyment. Only yes means yes – and yes should come from an engaged and enthusiastic partner.

> “Consent isn’t a question. It’s a state. If, instead of lovers, the two of you were synchronized swimmers, consent would be the water. It’s not enough to jump in, get wet and climb out - if you want to swim, you have to be in the water continually. And if you want to have sex, you have to be continually in a state of enthusiastic consent with your partner.”

**Consent** and open communication are key to positive sexual experiences for everyone involved.

## Let us know! 

**Please**, if you have had issues with someone, seen red flags or witnessed inappropriate behavior of someone on the ‘going-list’, **let us know**.
You can use Fetlife messages or [contact the orga]({{< ref "/docs/main/contact" >}} "Contact us") in some other way.
Feel free to use a pseudonymous account by creating a new mail address with protonmail/yahoo/fastmail/… 

Please describe the issues and propose a way for us to deal with them. Does this person need someone to work with them on their behavior? Could we assist in facilitating [restorative justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice)? Can they still attend but do we need to keep an eye on them? Can they attend if they promise not to interact with you? Or is the best solution for them not to attend the event?

We will assess the situation and try to think of the best solution, after which we will contact you to see if this solution works for you. No process is perfect, but we’ll try to find something that works for all involved parties.

# Our Valued FWB's

We are immensely grateful for our devoted team of volunteer welfare workers who are committed to promoting the well-being, safety, and comfort of all participants. Their dedication and expertise are essential to ensuring a positive event experience for everyone.

## First Aid Support

In case of minor injuries such as bruises, cuts, and burns, our trained volunteers are readily available to assist you. They serve as third-line supporters, following a step-by-step approach:

1. **Self-Care:** Prioritize attending to your own needs - take a break, pace yourself, and utilize the public first aid kit provided for treating minor injuries.
2. **Peer Support:** Reach out to friends or peers, who may be able to offer medical, emotional, or practical support in times of need.
3. **Welfare Workers:** If you require additional help, don't hesitate to escalate your concerns to a welfare worker. They will be easily identifiable through specific markers (details to be shared).

## Consent Crew

Our dedicated Consent Crew is focused on creating a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment for everyone at the event. They are available to offer guidance on matters related to consent, personal boundaries, and mutual respect. If desired by all parties involved, Consent Crew members can also act as mediators to resolve any disputes or conflicts.

## Neuro-Liaison

The Neuro-Liaison serves as a specialized point of contact for neurodiverse individuals, providing tailored support and assistance. They work closely with event organizers to suggest improvements that cater to the needs of neurodiverse participants. Additionally, they are equipped to mediate conflicts and address concerns, ensuring a positive and enjoyable experience for everyone.

## Join Our Team of Volunteers

If you are passionate about helping others and would like to contribute to our welfare worker team, we would love to have you on board. Our volunteers are the backbone of our events, and we truly appreciate their dedication and hard work. To apply for a volunteer position or learn more about the roles available, please contact the event organizers.

## I’d Like to Help out, but Honestly, I Have No Skills. What Can I Do?

At Rogue Rope Camp, [we’re all volunteers]({{<ref "volunteer.md" >}})
, and we always need more help! All of the Rogue Rope Camp participants volunteer in some capacity during, before, or after the event. Skills are less important than a can-do attitude and the willingness to work hard. Email [info@ropecamp.be](mailto:info@ropecamp.be) to offer more general help. Many hands make light work.

See the Volunteer page of this site.

## Can I Make Art?

Damn right! Rogue Rope Camp encourages participants to create and contribute art.

## But I Can’t Build Stuff or Make Art! What Can I Do?

Contribute in any way you can. You could cook, give manicures, massages, workshops or performances, and anything else that takes your fancy! 

Everyone has a valuable contribution to make.

Everything you bring to the site has the potential to become **MATTER OUT OF PLACE (MOOP)**: costumes, water bottles, booze containers, inflatable chairs, hats, fruit, cigarette butts, even rope fibers can all become MOOP. Every person is responsible for their own rubbish.

So, remember what your caregivers taught you: don't litter, put away your toys after playing, clean up after yourself.
We don't clean up after you. **I am not your caregiver (but you can call me daddy).**

## What Should I Do with my Rubbish?

One of the fundamental ideas of Leave No Trace (LNT) is : **Pack it in, pack it out**. Everything you brought to Rogue Rope Camp, you will have to take away before the end of the event.

**NEVER LET MOOP HIT THE GROUND. Clean as you go. MOOP attracts more MOOP. When you see trash on the ground, pick it up and take it with you to dispose of it.**

* **Carry a MOOP bag**. Wherever you go, carry a small bag to collect any MOOP you find.
* **Weigh items down/don’t let them get blown away**. Anything that can blow away: put weight on it or tie it down. 
* If you’re a smoker, **carry a portable ashtray**, such as a mint tin, with you at all times. Or put butts in your pocket. **Never, ever drop butts**.
* Do not let bins overflow and MOOP get out of hand.

* Peer Support: First, reach out to friends or peers, who may be able to offer medical, emotional, or practical support in times of need.

They are available to offer guidance on matters related to consent, personal boundaries, and mutual respect.

At Rogue Rope Camp, we welcome neuro diverse individuals and strive to accommodate their needs as best as possible. We encourage all participants to take responsibility for their own mental health and well-being while also being mindful of others.

If you feel comfortable doing so, communicate your needs and preferences to our neuro-volunteers, who are here to provide support and ensure that everyone feels included and respected. Our volunteers are passionate individuals who are committed to creating a safe and inclusive environment for all participants. If you're interested in volunteering as a mental health support person or neuro-liaison, please reach out to us for more information on how to get involved.

We also have a designated space on site where individuals can go if they need some time to themselves or just want to relax. This spot is quiet and free from distractions, so feel free to take some time out if you need it.

At Rogue Rope Camp, we believe in creating a supportive and inclusive environment for all participants, and we're committed to making sure that everyone has a positive and enjoyable experience. **We require all participants, neuro-typical or not, to be able to take care of their own needs and not pose a risk to others.** We believe that everyone has the right to feel safe and respected, and we will not tolerate any behavior that puts others at risk.

We encourage all participants to be mindful of their actions and how they may impact others. We ask that you respect other people's boundaries and communicate clearly with them. If you're unsure about something, please don't hesitate to ask one of our volunteers or staff members for guidance.

We hope that everyone has an amazing time at camp and that we can all learn from and support each other. ---

Dear friends, we know it can be fun to build your own little village at a festival with your friends, but unfortunately this is not an option at our camp. We have to use the campsite sparingly, so please feel free to bring the essentials, but try to minimize the space between tents. We'll be "defragmenting" like it's 1995!

But don't worry, we'll still have a chance to build a kinky village – just in the forest and in the communal areas of the camp instead.

We'll be providing electricity on the campsite. If you want to get connected, bring the longest extension cord you have and a power strip. This way, you can charge your mobile devices whenever necessary. Just a reminder: please don't connect power-hungry devices to the camping grid, like fridges, hair dryers, air conditioning units, or dishwashers.

We hope for good weather, but if it does rain, please don't dig a trench around your tent. This is explicitly mentioned in the lease and we want to leave the field in the same condition as we found it.

To help with fire safety, please try to limit smoking on the campsite between the tents. You're welcome to smoke near the fire pit, but make sure to keep it clean by disposing of your cigarette butts in the designated ash trays. If your smoke has a unique smell, that's fine – no need to hide it.

**Camping and Other Stuff to Bring**

* Your Christmas lights! Or other cool led strips. Let's make it funky at night.
* Toilet/shower facilities are indoor. The facilities are quite basic. There are 3 toilets so no smelly Dixie-toilets for us, thank you very much.
* A box cooler, or one of those supermarket insulation bags. A smaller bag or watertight container to preserve the ice, so your cooler won't become a pool.
* Please note: there is no need to bring dodgy gas stoves or other cooking gear, we will provide you with warm food.

**Sleeping**

You might be wondering if there is a possibility to sleep indoors? There is some room inside, but we'll be using that for activities. The safest option is to make sleeping arrangements outside (tent, van, camper, etc.).

### The Details

* **When:** 02/08/2023 14:00 -&gt; 06/08/2023 16:00
* **Where:** East of Ghent, West of Antwerp
* **Cost:** 150€

### Intro

Welcome to the **fourth** edition of Rogue Rope Camp, where we come together to learn, play, and grow as a community. Our focus is on rope, but we also value self-organization and resourcefulness. This camp is entirely run by volunteers, so we rely on **everyone** to pitch in and help with tasks such as food preparation, building and maintenance, cleaning, and taking care of each other.

We believe that by working together and supporting each other, we can create a **truly special and memorable experience** for everyone. At Rogue Rope, we provide the necessary infrastructure to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable, including a space to pitch your tent, food and drink, suspension points for rope activities, a sound system for music and events, power and water, toilets and warm showers to freshen up.

However, it's the collective effort of **all participants** that make this event truly remarkable. From leading workshops to creating an inclusive environment, every contribution is appreciated and valuable. There are no spectators here, only participants. We see this camp as a playground, a blank canvas waiting to be filled with your ideas and talents.

Please note that Rogue Rope Camp is an intense experience and **may not be suitable for everyone**. We encourage all potential participants to carefully consider whether this event aligns with their interests and comfort levels. With that said, we welcome anyone who is eager to participate and contribute to the event.

Thank you for your interest in Rogue Rope Camp, and we look forward to having you join our community of passionate and dedicated volunteers. Let's create an unforgettable event together!---

At our camp, we operate on a simple system: no one is paid and every participant pays for their own ticket. This means that we're all in this together, and it's up to us to make it a success. And by "us," we really mean you – we need your help to make this camp run smoothly.

There are roles and duties before the camp starts as well as during the camp. For the roles during the camp, we will be using a Google sheet for signups. For the roles before the camp, there will be a separate signup form.

To pitch in, we ask that every participant volunteers at least one time. Most shifts aren't too demanding – for example, cleanup shifts usually only take about 25 minutes.

The second volunteer shift we need, is that you help with the cleanup on Sunday. This sounds like a drag, but many hands make light work. And over the years we've learned to become very efficient with this.  

### Different Ways to Help

#### Before the Camp

Do you want to take a certain role sign up using the designated form for tasks that need to be done before the camp starts.

At the moment we're looking for: 
* deco leads 
* pioneering lead
* Leads for the FWB's : first aid and neuro-liaison

Do you want to take on this role? [Contact us!]({{< ref "/docs/main/contact" >}} "Contact us")

#### During the Camp

You can choose one or many of the following roles:

- **Kitcheneer**: Help out in the kitchen by preparing and serving food. You'll chop, slice, peel, heat and distribute, all while spreading good vibes and making people smile.

- **Production**: Get things done by moving and rigging equipment, but also be ready to clean the site and improvise. Work smart, not hard.

- **Support**: Welcome committee and greeters, crowd control, tent oversight – if nudging people to do the right thing is your thing, this is the role for you. Candidates must agree to put on a fluorescent jacket.

- **FWB**: Friends With Benefits, people working on first-aid, safety and consent.

### How to Register?

For roles before the camp,[contact us]({{< ref "/docs/main/contact" >}} "Contact us"). For roles during the camp, we will be using a Google sheet. You can sign up for shifts that interest you. If you don't find the time to sign up before you arrive, you will be asked to do so when you check in.


## But what if there aren't enough volunteers?

Then unfortunately, things like food preparation and cleaning may not get done. However, we can always find ways to have fun and make the most of our time together – even if it means lying down in a puddle of mud. :wink:

## Get to the Location

The site is in the province of East-Flanders. You can get there by car or public transport. The nearest train station is a 3-kilometer walk from the site. The nearest bus stop is a 1-kilometer walk away.

Our camping ground is 200 meters from the main road. **There is no parking on the camp site itself.** You can drive up, take out your bags, check in and then park your car **back on the main road**.
Take into account: you cannot drive your car onto the camping area! That is only accessible on foot. So, the last 40 meters or so, you will need to drag your stuff.

If you bring a camper or trailer, we **might** be able to put that on the field using our combined people-power. Important: if you plan to bring a van, camper, or trailer, **contact us to make sure there is some space.**

You made it! Make sure to bring your order confirmation with your qr-code, so we can verify payment. Also double check that you're wearing white socks in sandals! You will get a [release statement]({{<ref "release-statement.md" >}}) to sign.

You will be asked to sign up for a shift of work... This could be cleaning up, going to the bakery or making sure the fire is hot. As you arrive, we will ask you to put your name down.

Now it's time to relax, set up your tent and share a drink with us!

## Rope Play

Although you can basically use the site and infrastructure to do whatever you want, rope play is the main course of our menu. The setup will reference this.

Traditionally, we welcome rope play of _any_ level. There's this misconception that you have to be good with ropes to partake in Rogue Rope events. We don't know where this came from, but would like to stress that this is _not_ the case. Everyone is welcome. Everyone who wants to play with ropes should feel free to come and learn. Also, if your rope handling is basic, and you're happy with it and not interested to learn more, that's fine. If you want to try new stuff and have someone spot you, that's fine as well.

Everybody started from zero, and we're always interested in getting to know new people.

People who see tying as a competition have already lost it.

## Other Play

* Other play is welcome: whips, canes, chains, duck-tape, blood, fire. If you can think of it, you can bring it to Rogue Rope Camp.
* We're not afraid of nudity or sex. 
* There's only one caveat: at the camp site, golden showers and scat are hard to do in a 'clean' way, so we'll need to draw the line there.

There are 3 simple steps for you to complete to get in:

## Step 1: Read this Document

Doing really well there! Almost done.

(You didn't just skip all the info to get on this page, did you?)

Have any questions or comments? [Get in touch]({{< ref "/docs/main/contact" >}} "Contact us").

## Step 2: Do the registration thing. 

As some of you may already be aware, we have been organizing an annual event known as Rogue Rope Camp for several years now. In the past, we have had a relaxed approach towards the selection of participants, as long as they were not a threat to the safety of others. However, we have decided to change the way participants are selected this year.

Going forward, participation in Rogue Rope Camp will be considered a privilege, not a right. We aim to create a great event, and for that, we require individuals who not only prioritize safety but also contribute positively to the community. Therefore, we have delegated the selection process to a panel of five trusted individuals from different geographic areas. These individuals are well-versed in RRC culture and possess valuable insights into the scene and the community.

The panel members will remain anonymous. Hans will not participate in the judging process.

> "For some people, the registration process is scary: you state what you want and what you offer. You might get a yes or a no. If this makes you uncomfortable, you're probably not ready for the consent negotiations you need to do at camp."

We have published the [guidelines and registration for Rogue Rope Camp](https://doplr.xyz/guidelines.php). These guidelines will serve as a code of conduct and will also guide the judges in their decision-making.

We understand that some may have concerns with this new process. However, we want to reiterate that participation in Rogue Rope Camp is a privilege, not a right.

The judges will evaluate individuals based on their ability to  make positive contributions to the community and their compatibility with other participants. If your application is declined, please understand that various factors go into the decision-making process.

Thank you for your understanding.

## Step 3: Purchase a Ticket
Starting from the 8th of April at noon, you can buy a ticket for Rogue Rope Camp. Secure your spot and join us for an unforgettable experience!

For our regular visitors, here are the most important changes from last year:

## Infra

* More coziness! 
* More rope space + bamboo suspension points.
* Two words: Bouncy Balls!

In addition to these improvements, we have also made significant strides in enhancing the overall experience for our visitors this year. We have taken all of the feedback from last year's event and used it to fuel our innovations and create an even better event this year. 

By concentrating on fostering a cohesive and inclusive community, we hope to make this year's Rogue Rope event even more memorable and transformative for everyone involved.

# Food

## What's the general idea?

Bring a cooler, and we'll supply the ice!

Each morning, we'll gather for a communal brunch. We'll provide the bread, coffee, and tea. Anything else you'd like on your bread, please bring along and store it in your cooler to keep it fresh. If you need to purchase additional groceries, supermarkets are conveniently located within 2 km.

In the afternoon, we'll offer a light snack, such as hummus, salad, or ice cream. For dinner, we'll serve a warm meal, typically featuring a BBQ and the ever-popular frites-mobile.

While the camp provides basic sustenance, it's not an all-day buffet. So, if you enjoy cornflakes in the morning or like to snack throughout the day, bring your favorite munchies, nuts, granola bars, fruit, or chocolate bars. Customize your camp experience to your liking!

As a new addition this year, we'll have bread available throughout the day. Feel free to make yourself a sandwich whenever you please.

We offer **vegetarian** and **meat** options. When you sign up for a ticket, you will be asked to indicate your preference. Please note that to make the logistics of the menus work, you will need to stick with your choice.

Anything beyond vegetarian or meat diets is not within our current kitchen capacity. If you have very specific nutrition needs \(vegan, gluten-free, organic\),we are open to helping you, and can provide those with specific needs access to the kitchen. [Get in touch]({{< ref "/docs/main/contact" >}} "Contact us") and we'll work something out.

As you can see, this is **not** a culinary event, but we're confident that, with your help, we can make this work. So, prepare your taste buds for some nice surprises.

## Cancellation

If the event is not legal under Belgian or local laws (due to Covid waves/Putin/...), it shall not take place. In this case, everyone will receive a **full refund** for all costs \(tickets, drink vouchers\). No hidden fees will be deducted. If you paid X euros, we'll send you your X euros back via bank transfer.


## Personal Cancellation

If you can't attend for personal reasons \(sickness, change of plans, ... \) you can resell or gift your tickets. In this case, let the organizers know, so we can vet the person you want to sell your ticket to. Every participant needs to be confirmed by the orga. There is no point in selling your ticket to someone who won't be allowed to participate. So first, send an email to the orga, with your friend's FetLife name and email. We will send you both an email with instructions on how to proceed.
If you don't know anyone to take your ticket off your hands, and we have people on the waiting list, you can get a refund of 90% of the ticket price. If we don't have people on the waiting list, we can't make any refund promises but we will do our best to cut you a deal. Also in this case [contact the orga]({{< ref "/docs/main/contact" >}} "Contact us").

## Orga Cancellation

In case something happens that forces us to cancel the camp, you will get a full refund.

## Early Termination of the Event

If the event has started but has to be terminated early, due to harsh weather, acts of nature or other conditions beyond our control, the ticket price is not refundable.
