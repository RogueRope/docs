**Build Day Now Part of the Event Kickoff**  
Welcome all builders, helpers, and enthusiasts!

Our event now starts directly on Wednesday, transitioning smoothly from setup into the heart of the experience. There's no separate build day—when you arrive, you're part of the action from the get-go.

- **Be Ready to Dive In**: If you're joining us on Wednesday, come prepared to lend a hand or at least steer clear of the hustle. We're all about seamless collaboration, where play and work don't have to compete for space.
- **Play Time Guidelines**: To maintain focus and efficiency, play activities will be welcomed after dinner on Wednesday and in the late afternoon on Thursday. Provided they don't interfere with the build.
- **Open Invitation**: Feel free to show up when you can; the more, the merrier! No need for specific registration—just bring your enthusiasm.
- **Coordination Made Simple**: We're organizing through a specific WhatsApp group to coordinate the build. Feel free to join this group or simply show up at the camp. We’ll guide you through what’s needed on-site.

This isn't just a call to build; it's an invitation to be an integral part of setting the stage for our collective adventure. As you contribute, you're also connecting, absorbing the vibrant pre-event atmosphere, and imprinting your personal touch on our gathering's foundation.

Your participation transforms mere preparation into the first stroke of our shared masterpiece. If you're drawn to contribute to something greater, come join us from the onset and help lay the foundation for an unforgettable Rogue Rope Camp.
