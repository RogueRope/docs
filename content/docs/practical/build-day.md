The stage is set for an unforgettable event, but before the journey of exploration begins, we have a day of creation—our **Build**!

This isn’t a one-person show; it’s a collective symphony. From the early hours, we’re inviting as many hands as possible to help construct the backdrop for our winter experience. 

This call is for the crafty, the willing, and the spirited. Whether you’re skilled with a drill or simply have a vision to share, your contribution is invaluable. The tasks will vary, ensuring there’s a place for everyone’s talents. And remember, this is more than just preparation—it’s the first stroke of our shared canvas.

### Build Details:
- **Start Time**: Build begins around **14:00 on January 2nd**, feel free to drop in whenever.
- **End Time**: We aim to wrap things up by **late afternoon/early evening**.

Becoming a part of Build Day is not just about giving—it’s also about receiving. You’ll forge connections, soak in the pre-event energy, and leave your personal mark on the event’s very foundation. Let’s create something amazing together!
