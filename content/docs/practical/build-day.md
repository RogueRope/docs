The stage is set for an unforgettable event, but before the journey of exploration begins, we have a day of creation - our Build Day!

This isn't a one-person show; it’s a collective symphony. From the early hours, we're inviting as many hands as possible to help construct the backdrop for our winter experience. We’ve left behind the concept of PreCamp to focus on a dedicated Build Day where every moment counts.

This call is for the crafty, the willing, and the spirited. Your skillset, whether it's wielding a drill or weaving a vision into reality, is invaluable. The tasks vary, ensuring there’s a place for every talent. And remember, this is more than just preparation; it’s the first stroke of our shared canvas.

Here’s the twist: becoming a part of Build Day is not just about giving but also receiving. You'll forge connections, soak in the pre-event energy, and leave your personal imprint on the event's very foundation.

If you’re eager to contribute to something larger than life, mark your calendar and join us in laying the groundwork for an epic winter edition of _Bottoms Up!_ After registration you will recieve a mail on how to join the build day.
