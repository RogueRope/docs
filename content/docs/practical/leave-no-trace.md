## The Basic Idea

Care for shared space is collective. Notice what's yours. Pick it up. Clean what you use. Respect what others have left.

---

## During the Event

**Meal areas:**

- Clean up immediately after eating
- Wipe your table
- Don't leave food out

**Play spaces:**

- Wipe down equipment after use
- Coil rope and return it
- Return furniture to its place

**Sleeping areas:**

- Keep your bunk organized
- Don't leave clothes on floors
- Return shared items to their place

**Bathrooms:**

- Shower quickly
- Wipe surfaces
- Dispose of menstrual products in provided bins

**General:**

- Take trash with you
- Put lights out when you leave rooms
- If you see something off, fix it or report it

## Final Day Checkout

- Strip your bed
- Collect all your belongings
- Clean your bunk area
- Return room key
- Leave nothing behind except gratitude

---

## After You Leave

**Sharing photos publicly (FetLife, Instagram, blogs):**
Only share shots where **every person** consented **before** the photo **and** to **public posting**.
**No bystanders.** **Anonymize the venue** (no names, wide establishing shots, signage, maps, time/location details).
Be ready to **delete** if anyone changes their mind later.

**Respect people's privacy online.** Don't out anyone. Don't tag without consent. Protect the sacredness of what happened.

## Why It Matters

When we leave space better than we found it, we:

- Show respect for the venue
- Demonstrate consent (even to the building)
- Practice caring—which is what this gathering is about
- Make the next gathering possible

**It becomes a practice you carry into your life.**
