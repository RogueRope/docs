## The Basic Idea

Care for shared space is collective. Notice what's yours. Pick it up. Clean what you use. Respect what others have left.

---

## During the Event

We share these rooms like we share scenes: with care, attention, and a sense that someone else will arrive after us. Notice what needs doing and do it if you can.

**Meal areas** stay inviting when we clear plates, wipe tables, and tuck leftovers away before they wander off on their own. If you see dishes waiting for a wash, give them a quick rinse or run them to the dish station.

**Play spaces** breathe easier when equipment gets a wipe-down, ropes are coiled, and furniture finds its home again. Think of it as resetting the stage for whoever comes next.

**Sleeping areas** feel restful when bunks stay loosely organized, clothes live in bags instead of on floors, and shared items boomerang back to where everyone expects them.

**Bathrooms** move faster when showers stay short, surfaces get a quick swoosh, and anything disposable lands in the bins provided (menstrual products included).

**General vibe:** carry your trash with you, flip lights off if you’re the last one out, and if something looks off, either tend to it or tap an organizer. Shared responsibility is the kink here.

## After You Leave

If you plan to share photos or memories beyond our private channels, read the “After the Gathering” section of [Photography Guidelines]({{< ref "/docs/practical/photography-guidelines" >}} "Photography Guidelines") for consent refreshers, venue anonymity, and deletion requests. Protect the people and the place the same way you did on site.

---

## Why It Matters

When we leave space better than we found it, we:

- Show respect for the venue
- Demonstrate consent (even to the building)
- Practice caring—which is what this gathering is about
- Make the next gathering possible

**It becomes a practice you carry into your life.**
