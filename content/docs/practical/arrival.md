## Before You Arrive

Take a breath. You're about to cross a threshold.

Maybe you're nervous. Maybe you're excited. Maybe both at once.
That's exactly right. This is a big moment — you're choosing vulnerability, connection, presence.

**You belong here.**

This page will walk you through what happens when you arrive, where to go, who you'll meet, and how the first 24 hours unfold. We've got you.

## Wednesday Afternoon: Build Day (Optional, Recommended)

**Arrival window:** Anytime from 14:00 onwards

If you can come early, **please do.** Build Day is one of the most beautiful ways to arrive.

There's something intimate about shaping the space together before it holds us. Hanging fairy lights. Arranging cushions. Setting up play areas. Making coffee. Making eye contact. Making meaning.

**You don't need skills. You don't need to know what you're doing.**
Someone will hand you a task. You'll work alongside strangers who won't be strangers for long.

By the time Opening Circle begins, you'll already have your first inside jokes, your first shared glances, your first sense of *oh, these are my people.*

### What to Do When You Arrive for Build Day

1. **Park and find the main entrance** — Look for welcome signs
2. **Drop your bags in your room** — Find your bunk, claim your space
3. **Come back to the common area** — Someone will guide you to whatever needs doing

No pressure. No performance. Just presence.

## Wednesday Evening: Main Arrival

**Arrival deadline:** 21:00 (for Opening Circle)

Most people arrive Wednesday evening between 16:00–20:30. You'll see cars pulling in, people hauling bags, nervous laughter, tentative hellos.
Build will still be going on, drop your stuff in your room and help us out. 

### The Check-In Process

**Step 1: Find Registration (18:00–20:30)**

Look for the registration table near the main entrance. You'll see:
- A table with a sign that says "Welcome" or "Check-In"
- One or two friendly faces 
- Other arrivals milling about, looking as nervous as you feel

**Step 2: Check In**

Tell us your name. We'll:
- Check you off the list
- Give you a **welcome pack** 
- Answer any immediate questions 
- Point you toward your accommodations

**Step 3: Settle Into Your Room**

Find your room, at least one is FLINTA. You'll be in a shared bunk room with 4–8 other people.

- Claim a bunk (first-come, first-served)
- Unpack what you need for the night
- Meet your roommates (or not — some people need quiet time first)
- Change into comfortable clothes if you want

**Step 4: Explore (If You Have Time)**

Before Opening Circle begins at 21:00, wander a little:
- Find the bathrooms
- Locate the kitchen/common area
- Peek into the play spaces (they'll be empty, waiting)
- Breathe. Let your nervous system catch up.

You don't have to talk to anyone yet if you're not ready.
Just let the space start to feel familiar.

## Understanding the Space

- **Consent Crew area** — We'll introduce them at Opening Circle

### Where Things Are

## Who's Who: Finding Support & Connection

One of the most common questions: **"Who do I talk to if I need help?"**

Here's how to identify key people:

### FWBs (Friends With Bracelets)

Anyone wearing a **colored bracelet** is a **Friend With Bracelet (FWB).**

This means they're open to:
- Holding space for a check-in
- Listening without fixing
- Helping you find resources
- Offering a grounding presence

**You can become an FWB too.** Bracelets will be available throughout the event. When you feel resourced enough to care for others, put one on.

**How to approach an FWB:**
- "Hey, I see you're wearing a bracelet. Do you have a minute?"
- "I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — could we sit for a moment?"
- "I'm new and not sure how to [ask someone to play / find the quiet room / etc.] — can you help?"

### Consent Crew

Consent Crew members will be introduced at **Opening Circle.** They're here for:
- Boundary violations or consent concerns
- Conflict mediation
- Safety issues
- Situations that feel off or unsafe

**How to reach them:**
- Find them in person (ask anyone if you're not sure who they are)
- Email: consent-crew@roguerope.be
- Emergency contact (shared at Opening Circle)

### Organizers

The folks who built this space. We'll introduce ourselves at Opening Circle.

**We're here for:**
- Logistics questions (food, accommodations, schedules)
- Venue issues (heating, access, supplies)
- General "I don't know who to ask" questions

You'll see us moving through the space, checking in, making coffee, adjusting things.

### Everyone Else

Most people here are just like you — nervous, excited, figuring it out.

Some have been before. Some haven't.
Some are confident. Some are quiet.
All of them are here because they chose connection over comfort.

**You can talk to anyone.** More on that below.

## Opening Circle (Wednesday 21:00) — Mandatory

This is the threshold ritual. **Everyone must be present.**

### What Is It?

Opening Circle is our collective landing. It's where we:
- Breathe together for the first time
- Ground in consent and shared agreements
- Meet each other's eyes
- Set the container for the days ahead

**It's not a lecture. It's a ritual.**

### What Happens

- We'll gather in a circle (literally)
- Facilitators will guide us through:
  - A grounding practice (breathing, feeling our bodies, arriving)
  - Introduction to key people (organizers, Consent Crew)
  - Consent agreements (enthusiastic, ongoing, collective)
  - Practical info (where things are, daily rhythm, how to ask for help)
  - Community agreements (how we care for each other)
- We'll share brief introductions (just your name, no need for a speech)
- We'll set an intention together

**How long:** ~60–90 minutes

**What to bring:** Just yourself. Wear something comfortable. Sit on the floor or grab a cushion.

### After Opening Circle

When the circle closes, the gathering truly begins.

Some people will drift to the play spaces. Some will stay in the lounge and talk. Some will make tea and sit quietly. Some will go to bed early, overwhelmed and needing rest.

**All of it is okay.**

There's no "right" way to start. Follow what feels true.

## Your First Conversations

**"How do I even start talking to people?"**

We hear you. This is one of the hardest parts.

### You Don't Have to Be Interesting

You don't need a clever opening line. You don't need to perform.

Here are some honest, easy ways to start:

**Simple openers:**
- "Is this your first time here?"
- "How are you feeling so far?"
- "I'm [name]. I have no idea what I'm doing." (People love honesty.)
- "Do you know where the [coffee / quiet room / bathroom] is?" (Even if you do.)
- "Can I sit here?" (Then just sit. Sometimes presence is enough.)

**If you're nervous, say so:**
- "I'm feeling a bit shy — is it okay if I just sit with you quietly?"
- "I'm working up the courage to talk to people. You're my first attempt."

Vulnerability is currency here. Use it.

### If You're Coming Solo

You're not alone — about 60% of attendees come solo.

**Ways to connect:**
- Come to Build Day (easiest way to make early connections)
- Sit in the common area with a cup of tea (people will find you)
- Ask someone at dinner if you can join them
- Offer to help with something (dishes, tidying, setting up)
- Attend the Consent Moment on Thursday morning (everyone will be there)

**You will find your people.** It might not happen in the first hour. That's okay.

By day 2, you'll have inside jokes. By day 4, you'll have people who feel like family.

### If You're Coming With a Partner

You might be tempted to stay close to them. That's natural.

But also: **let yourself wander.**

Part of the magic here is meeting people outside your usual orbit. Your partner will still be there. And you'll have more to share when you reconvene.

Talk beforehand about:
- How much time you want together vs. apart
- Whether you'll check in at meals or just find each other organically
- What kind of connection (flirting, play, etc.) feels okay with others

Jealousy might come up. That's normal. More on that in [Partners](/docs/wellbeing/partners).

## The First Night

### After Opening Circle: What Now?

**Option 1: Stay up and explore**
- Hang out in the lounge
- Wander into a play space and watch (or ask to play)
- Make new friends over tea
- Flirt. Connect. Be soft.

**Option 2: Go to bed early**
- You've traveled. You're tired. Your nervous system is processing.
- Sleep is sacred. No one will judge you for resting.

**Option 3: Find a quiet corner**
- Process alone for a bit
- Journal, breathe, cry if you need to
- Come back to the group when you're ready

All of these are valid. Honor what you need.

### Sleep Logistics

**Shared rooms:**
- Bunk beds (bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper)
- People will come and go at different hours
- Some folks stay up late; some wake early
- Respect quiet hours as best you can

**If you can't sleep:**
- Wander to the common area (there's always someone awake)
- Make tea
- Sit by the fire
- Read, write, be

**If you're overwhelmed:**
- Find the quiet room
- Find an FWB (someone with a bracelet)
- Step outside for air
- It's okay to feel a lot. This space can hold it.

---

## Thursday Morning: Your First Full Day


**Your options:**
- Jam spaces (open areas for rope play)
- Lounge and talk
- Rest, read, journal
- Offer to lead something (a workshop, a ritual, a walk)
- Flirt, connect, explore
- Just *be*

For the full rhythm of the days, see [Experience Structure](/docs/concept/experience).

## Common First-Day Feelings

### "I don't know anyone."
**You will.** Give it time. By tonight, you'll recognize faces. By tomorrow, you'll have friends.

### "Everyone else seems to know what they're doing."
**They don't.** Most people are figuring it out as they go. Even the ones who've been here before.

### "I feel shy / awkward / out of place."
**You're not alone.** Half the room feels this way. The ones who look confident? They're probably faking it too.

### "I'm overwhelmed."
**That's okay.** Find the quiet room. Find an FWB. Take a break. You don't have to do everything.

### "I want to play but don't know how to ask."
**Start small.** "I'd love to tie with you sometime this week — would you be open to that?"
Or: "I'm new to this. Could we do something simple together?"

People will meet you where you are.

---

## You've Got This

Arrival is the hardest part.

Once you're here, once you've crossed the threshold, once you've said your name in Opening Circle — the rest will unfold.

You don't have to know what you're doing.
You don't have to be ready.
You just have to be here.

And you are.

Welcome home.

---

## Quick Reference

**Lost or confused?** Ask anyone. Seriously.

**Need support?** Find an FWB (colored bracelet) or Consent Crew member.

**Feeling overwhelmed?** Quiet room is always available.

**Want to connect but don't know how?** Sit in the common area with tea. People will find you.

**First night jitters?** Totally normal. It gets easier.
