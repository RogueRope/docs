## Getting Your Ticket: Saying Yes (When You Mean It)

A ticket isn't just entry — it's commitment.
To show up. To co-create. To meet this intensity with presence.

Securing your spot at Bottoms Up! is simple — but we ask that you move slowly. This isn't just about clicking "buy." It's about saying yes, with your whole self.

---

## Before You Commit: Reflect First

If you've made it to this page, you've probably explored the rest of the site. (If not, we lovingly encourage you to pause and wander back through the other pages.)

This isn't a spectator gathering. It's immersive. Real. Sometimes beautifully raw.
We want you to arrive with your eyes wide open — excited, ready, and fully informed about what you're stepping into.

---

### Ask Yourself First

Before you grab a ticket, take a breath. Ask yourself:

- Does this call to where I'm at right now?
- Will it nourish me — or stretch me too thin?
- Do I have the capacity (emotionally, physically, financially) to be fully present?

**FOMO is not a good reason to come.**
You deserve more than that. And so does this space. This gathering asks for your full presence — not your anxious attendance.

Come because it's a yes in your gut.
Not a maybe in your mind.

### Can't Afford It Right Now?

If money is the only thing standing between you and this experience, please reach out.
We're open to real conversation — and committed to finding a solution that honors both your needs and ours.

That might mean a sliding scale, a payment plan, work exchange, or creative alternatives.
No shame. No complicated applications. Just honest conversation and mutual care.

**Email us at [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be)** and let us know what's manageable.
We'll meet you where we can.

### Beyond Your Ticket: A Wearable Memory

Gathering with us? Consider taking home a thoughtfully designed t-shirt — a soft, high-quality keepsake that celebrates what you've shared. Each shirt is €25.

**Pre-order before the gathering** to guarantee your size and have it waiting at check-in. Or **order online after the event** if you want to think about it first. We'll handle shipping to you — no need to carry it home with you.

## Life Happens: Cancellations, Refunds & Changes

We understand life happens. Plans change. Circumstances shift. We're not here to punish you for that.

**That said,** once you register, we commit resources — food, accommodations, supplies are ordered. Our policy balances your needs with our real costs.

---

## Cancellation & Refund Policy

### The Clear Rule: Up to 3 Weeks Before = Full Refund

**Cancellation window:** Up to 3 weeks before the event (by January 25, 2026)

**Refund:** 100% refund via our ticket vending system

**How to cancel:**

1. Log into your ticket vending account
2. Request cancellation/refund
3. Refund processes within 7 days to your original payment method

**Why this works:** This gives us time to sell your spot to someone on the waitlist, adjust food orders, and reallocate accommodations.

---

### After 3 Weeks: No Refunds

**Cancellation window:** Less than 3 weeks before the event (after January 25, 2026)

**Refund:** No refund

**Why:** We've already purchased food, locked in accommodations, and confirmed our supply chain. Your payment covers costs we've already incurred.

**BUT:** You have options available (see Ticket Transfers & Resale section below).

---

### Partial Attendance

#### What If I Can Only Come 2–3 Days?

**You still pay full price** (€169).

**Why:** Food, accommodations, and support are bundled. We can't break them apart.

**But you can:**

- Leave early (Friday instead of Sunday): Totally fine; meals adjust but price stays same

**Important:** You must arrive by Wednesday 21:00 for the Opening Circle. If you cannot commit to this, this gathering may not be right for you.

**Better option:** If you need partial attendance, **reach out before registering.** Maybe we can work something out. But expect to pay full price.

---

### No-Show Policy

#### If You Don't Show Up

**Without notice:**

- You forfeit your ticket (no refund)
- We keep your payment
- Your spot can't be reallocated

**With late notice:**

- See refund timeline above

**In emergency (hospitalized, accident, etc.):**

- **Contact us ASAP** when you're able
- We'll assess your situation
- Possible deferral or resale facilitation (depending on circumstances)

## Ticket Transfers & Resale

### Your Option If You Can't Attend

**You can resell your ticket to someone else.** This way, your money doesn't disappear — it goes to the new buyer.

**How it works:**

1. **Find a buyer** (friend, community group, WhatsApp community, etc.)
2. **Email us** at [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) with:
   - Your name and order number
   - Their name and email
   - Subject: "Ticket transfer request"
3. **We vet the buyer** (quick check — ensuring they understand the event and values)
4. **Once approved,** the transfer is complete in our system
5. **The buyer pays you directly** (we don't handle the money transfer)

**Why we vet:** We want to protect the community and ensure people arrive with aligned expectations.

**Cost to you:** Free. No processing fee. The buyer reimburses you directly.

---
### Resale Rules

- **You set the price** (we don't control it; that's between you and buyer)
- **You handle payment** (we don't facilitate money transfer)
- **We vet the buyer** (just to protect the community)
- **No processing fee** from us
- **Contact us first** before selling (so we can coordinate vetting)

---
