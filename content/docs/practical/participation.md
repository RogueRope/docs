## What Your Contribution Covers

€169 keeps the gathering intimate and sustainable. Your ticket includes:

- **4 nights of communal lodging** — shared rooms with mattresses and bedding
- **One hot meal per day** — plus coffee, tea, snacks, and a stocked communal kitchen
- **All shared spaces & supplies** — lounge areas, dungeon furnishings, safety gear
- **Consent & care infrastructure** — trained hosts, wellbeing support, and quiet zones
- **Workshops, circles, and peer-led offerings** — everything on the [Schedule](/docs/schedule)

## Who This Is For

This container is for people who want to co-create — not spectate. We welcome:

- Curious newcomers ready to engage with consent-forward rope and intimacy
- Returning community members eager to deepen connection and service
- Folks who can honor boundaries, give explicit consent, and care for shared space

If you're unsure, start with [Is This For You?](/concept/is-this-for-you) for reflection before committing.

## Reserving Your Spot

1. **Decide with care.** Review the [Practical overview](/docs/practical) and [Policies](/docs/practical/policies).
2. **Register when tickets open.** Sales start **December 1, 2025** with 42 spots available.
3. **Confirm via payment.** We send payment instructions after registration; your spot is held once payment lands.

Need flexibility? See [Cancellations & Transfers](/docs/practical/cancellation-and-transfers) for refund windows and name changes.

## Accessibility & Participation Notes

- You can arrive Wednesday and depart early if needed; communicate timing on registration.
- Participation is never coerced. Scenes require explicit consent; witnessing is optional.
- Bring the gear you rely on: meds, mobility aids, sensory tools, earplugs, eye masks.
- Financial access matters. If pricing is a barrier, tell us in your registration notes so we can explore options.
