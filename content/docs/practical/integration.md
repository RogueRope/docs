## Specific Situations

### If You're Feeling Lonely

The end of an intense gathering can feel isolating. The remedy is reconnection.

**What helps:**

- Join the WhatsApp community immediately
- RSVP for the monthly community call
- Reach out to someone you met (even a small message)
- Go to a local rope jam or kink community event
- Plan to attend the next gathering NOW (tickets often sell out)
- Get a therapist who understands rope/kink

**You are not alone.** The people you met are feeling this too. Many are reaching out. Meet them.

### If You're Struggling with Emotions

Rope events stir up feelings — fear, joy, grief, desire, vulnerability. This is part of the work. But sometimes the feelings are overwhelming.

**What helps:**

- Talk to someone (friend, community member, therapist)
- Move your body
- Practice grounding (feet on earth, 5-4-3-2-1 sensory awareness)
- Reach out to the community support channel
- Remember: feelings pass

**If you're in crisis:**

- National crisis line: [number]
- Text crisis support: [number]
- Go to an ER if you're unsafe
- Call a trusted person

**Kink-competent therapists** understand rope, BDSM, power dynamics, and consent. They can help you process safely. [Referral list]

### If You're Processing a Relationship Change

Sometimes rope gatherings shift relationships — romantic partnerships, friendships, or self-understanding.

**This is deep work. You might:**

- Feel closer to your partner (or want to leave)
- Realize something about yourself
- Grieve a friendship or dynamic that changed
- Experience unexpected jealousy or desire
- Feel alone or unseen in your "regular" life

**What helps:**

- Talk to your partner or friend (honest, vulnerable conversations)
- Journal about what's shifting
- Get support from the community (others have navigated this)
- See a therapist who understands polyamory/kink/relationship complexity
- Attend the next gathering (these events create lasting transformation over time)
