Getting your ticket to Bottoms Up! is super simple. Here's how:

## Step 1: Know the Event

First off, make sure you're up to speed with what Bottoms Up! is all about. If you haven't yet, give our event info a quick read. If you've got any questions, feel free to [contact us]({{< ref "/docs/practical/contact" >}} "Contact us").

## Step 2: Choose Your Ticket

**Voucher Ticket**: For our familiar faces, those who’ve been with us before or are closely connected. It's not just a ticket; it’s a token of trust within our community.

**Open Ticket**: Open to anyone! Whether you're new or returning, this one’s for you. However, we’ll confirm your participation to ensure everyone’s comfort and safety. To do this, we'll need your FetLife name and a little info about you and your expectations. You’ll be asked these questions during the ticket sale process, so take your time and answer truthfully.

*Open ticket sales start on September 29th at 20:00.*

## Step 3: Buy Your Ticket

Once you've picked your ticket, go ahead and complete the purchase securely.
