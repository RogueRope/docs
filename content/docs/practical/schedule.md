# Week at a glance (Wed → Sun)

These are the **big lines** — a gentle container, not a rigid program. We'll adjust to what the space and the group need.
Expect a little mystery. Expect consent to be crystal clear.

- Arrival & settling in
- **Opening circle** to land together + set intentions

## Small notes

- **Swap shop:** bring a few items you'd genuinely love to pass on (optional).
- **Wheel of Consent / Shadow Play / Ritual:** you can join at your pace. Watching, resting, and opting out are all valid.
- The thread through everything: **ask clearly, listen fully, check in again.**
