**Never film or photograph anyone without their explicit consent.** This includes being mindful of people in the background of your shots.

If you ever run into an issue regarding photography, please let the organizers know. Remember, your right to take or post a photo **never** overrules someone else’s right to privacy. If you're posting photos on FetLife or any social media, **MAKE 100% SURE** that **EVERYONE** in the picture has agreed to it being shared. Don’t tag anyone online unless they’ve explicitly said it’s okay.

If you have any questions about photography or filming at our event, please [contact the orga]({{< ref "/docs/practical/contact" >}} "Contact us").

## Do NOT Post Pictures of the Site!

Please refrain from posting identifiable pictures of the location online. We want to continue using the site in future years, and part of that means respecting its privacy. The site itself didn’t consent to being photographed, so let’s keep it off social media. You can take pictures for personal use, just don’t share them publicly.

If you’re taking a picture with identifiable parts of the site in the background, feel free to capture the moment, but please don’t publish it. Be extra careful with social media—you might think a pseudo-anonymous account is safe, but platforms often upload more data than you realize.
