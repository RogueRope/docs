**Never film or photograph someone without their explicit consent.** This includes people in the background of a photo you're taking.

If you have a dispute with someone about photography, please let the organizer know. Your right to take someoneâ€™s photo and publish it **never** over-rules their right to privacy! If posting photos onto FetLife or other social networking sites, **MAKE 100% SURE** that **EVERYONE** featured in your photos is happy for them to be posted. You should not be tagging people online unless you have their explicit permission to do so.

If you have any questions about photography or filming at our winter event, please [contact the orga]({{< ref "/docs/practical/contact" >}} "Contact us").

## Do NOT Post Pictures of the Site!

Please do not publish identifiable pictures of the location. This includes the building, certain signs or plaques, etc... A tree isn't recognizable, the building, signs and interior spaces are. 
We want to keep using the site the coming years. Therefore, we ask you to not burn our location. The site provides us with privacy, and we should be able to return the favor. The site did not consent to being photographed and published, so just don't.  Take this into account when taking a picture, but particularly when posting online. Feel free to take pics of the site for personal use.

If we spot a picture that clearly shows where the event took place, we will spank your bottom and ask you to edit it or take it down. This **includes** photos posted on FetLife.

If you want to make a picture of someone where identifiable parts are in the background, feel free to do so, but just don't publish them. Take extra care in regards to social media, you might think it's fun to have a pseudo-anonymous Insta, FB, YouTube or Twitter account, but when you publish a picture, often more is uploaded than you might assume.
