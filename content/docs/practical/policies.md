## How to Use This Page

Think of this as the catchall for policies that don’t warrant full pages of their own. For anything detailed — tickets, travel, accommodations — follow the links to the canonical guides.

---

## Tickets & Money

- Refunds are available up to **3 weeks before the gathering**; after that we can’t issue cash back  
- Need to resell, gift, or defer your ticket? Check in with us first so we can vet the new human  
- Arriving late (after Wednesday 21:00 Opening Circle) isn’t an option

Full details live in: [Cancellation & Refund Policy](cancellation-policy) and [Ticket Transfers & Resale](ticket-transfers)

## Photography & Privacy

This is a consent-first space. Only take images when you have explicit permission from everyone in frame, keep cameras unobtrusive, and be prepared to delete on request. When sharing publicly, anonymize the venue, confirm consent again, and delete if anyone revokes permission.

Full guidance lives in → [Photography Guidelines](photography-guidelines)

## Venue Respect

Clean as you go, return gear to where you found it, and treat communal areas like a beloved friend’s home. Waste sorting, bathroom etiquette, and checkout instructions are spelled out in [Leave No Trace & Space Care](leave-no-trace).

## Health & Safety

### Before You Arrive

- Skip the gathering if you’re sick or contagious  
- Bring medications and mobility aids you rely on  
- Tell us in advance about health needs or accessibility requests  
- Check in with yourself: do you have the capacity for an immersive communal experience right now?

### During the Event

- Eat, hydrate, and rest — intensity lands softer when your body has fuel  
- Use quiet spaces, FWBs, or organizers when you need support  
- Leave if you must; re-enter when you’re ready  
- Report concerns early so we can respond with care

### Consent, Substances & Transparency

- Consent is continuous and can be withdrawn at any moment  
- “No” and “I’m done” are complete sentences  
- Read non-verbal cues; when in doubt, pause and check in  
- Be honest about your headspace and any substances (alcohol, cannabis, prescriptions, anything) that could impact your judgment or ability to consent  
- If you witness something troubling, flag the Consent Crew — you’re not “making a fuss,” you’re stewarding the container

---

## Emergencies & Support

- Consent Crew: introduced at Opening Circle, available day and night  
- First aid: trained responders on site; nearest hospital is in Mol (~10 minutes)  
- Crisis support: ask for help early; we’d rather over-support than miss a rupture
