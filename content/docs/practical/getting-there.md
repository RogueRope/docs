## Build Day - Wednesday Afternoon

### Arrival flows into build.

Bottoms Up! doesn't just _appear_.
It's built — by hands, by hearts, by you.

Our gathering now begins on **Wednesday afternoon**, with **Build Day** folded into the experience itself. No separation. No staff. Just a space, some rope, and a growing circle of people making it real.

This is your invitation to be part of the beginning.

### What to Expect

You don't need to be strong. Or skilled. Or organized.  
You just need to show up.

We'll hang lights, set up suspension points, decorate the space, arrange the chill spaces, maybe even rig a secret nook or two. Some will hammer. Some will sweep. Some will make tea and tell stories. All of it counts.

Come early. Arrive Wednesday afternoon if you can.
This is one of the best ways to meet people, soften into the vibe, and become part of the magic _before_ it officially begins.

### Wednesday 21:00 is Mandatory

**You must arrive by Wednesday 21:00 for the Opening Circle.** This is not flexible.

This ritual is the threshold—it shapes how we hold space together, sets our collective agreements, and creates the energetic foundation for everything that follows.

If you cannot commit to being present Wednesday evening, this gathering isn't the right fit for you this year. We'd rather you honor your real capacity and join us when you can fully show up.

**No late arrivals.** Plan accordingly.
