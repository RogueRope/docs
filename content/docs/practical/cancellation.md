## Cancellation

If the event is not legal under Belgian or local laws (due to pandemics, geopolitical events, etc.), it will not take place. In this case, everyone will receive a **full refund** for all costs (tickets, drink vouchers). No hidden fees will be deducted—if you paid X euros, we’ll return X euros via bank transfer.

You can also cancel and receive a **full refund** up until **December 15** for any reason, no questions asked. After this date, standard personal cancellation policies apply.

## Personal Cancellation

If you can’t attend for personal reasons (sickness, change of plans, etc.), you’re free to resell or gift your ticket. Just let the organizers know, as every participant needs to be confirmed. Send an email with the buyer's FetLife name and email, and we’ll guide you both through the process to make it official.

If you don’t know anyone to take your ticket, and we have people on the waiting list, you can get a **90% refund**. If we don’t have anyone on the list, we can’t guarantee a refund, but we’ll do our best to help. In either case, [contact the orga]({{< ref "/docs/practical/contact" >}} "Contact us").

## Orga Cancellation

If something happens and we’re forced to cancel the event, you will receive a **full refund**.

## Early Termination of the Event

If the event starts but must end early due to uncontrollable factors (severe weather, natural disasters, etc.), unfortunately, the ticket price is **non-refundable**.
