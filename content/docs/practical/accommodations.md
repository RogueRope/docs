Gone are the days of camping in the open field – this winter, we're moving indoors. Our event will feature dormitory-style sleeping arrangements, equipped with sturdy bunk beds for a restful night's sleep after a day of connection and exploration.

We offer differentiated sleeping quarters to cater to various needs, including FLINTA (women, lesbians, inter, non-binary, trans, agender) and snoring rooms, ensuring comfort and consideration for all attendees.

**Accommodation Highlights:**

* **Budget-friendly Hostel Feel**: Get the full festival experience with the comfort of being indoors, perfect for the chilly winter months.
* **Bunk Beds**: Cozy up in your own bunk, complete with a mattress. Just remember to bring your own bedding or sleeping bag.
* **Mixed, FLINTA and Snoring Rooms**: Choose a room that suits your comfort, whether it's a quieter space or one that accommodates snoring.
* **Community Atmosphere**: Our shared spaces promote interaction and connection, even when you're winding down for the day.

**Additional Information:**

* **Indoor Facilities**: We've got the essentials covered with indoor toilets and showers – no porta-potties here!
* **Electricity Access**: Charge your devices conveniently indoors, but remember, energy-hungry appliances are a no-go.
* **Respect the Space**: Treat our dorms with care so everyone can enjoy a pleasant stay.
* **Mindful Smoking**: Designated outside smoking areas are available for those who wish to indulge.

**What to Bring:**

* **Bedding**: A sleeping bag or your own bed linens for the bunk beds.
* **Personal Essentials**: Toiletries, towels, and anything else you'd need for a comfortable hostel stay.
* **Decorative Flair**: Feel free to bring LEDs or other light decorations to personalize your space and add to the ambiance.

**Please Note:**

The indoor space is limited, so while we encourage you to bring your personal touch, we ask that you keep the shared areas clutter-free. We're all in this together, creating a harmonious and enjoyable environment for our winter journey.
