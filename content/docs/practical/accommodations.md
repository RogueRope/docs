## Sleeping Close

Nights shape us as much as days.
The way we rest, the way we hear each other breathing, the way we wake up into shared light — it all weaves into the story of this gathering.

This isn't about luxury.
It's about proximity. About choosing to be held by a space, and by each other.

### What You'll Find

**🏠 Indoor Accommodations:**

- **Bunk beds indoors** — no tents, no weather worries. Each person gets their own bed and mattress. Bring the bedding that makes you feel safe and soft.
- **Real facilities** — hot showers, indoor toilets, places to brush your teeth, splash water on your face, and return renewed.

**🛏️ Room Options:**

- **Mixed rooms** — for those who like variety
- **FLINTA-only rooms** — for women (including trans women), lesbians, intersex, non-binary, trans, and agender folks. Self-defined; no gatekeeping.

_Self-defined: choose this if you identify with any part of FLINTA. We don’t police identity; pick what helps you rest._

- **"Snoring sanctuary"** — for heavy sleepers and their companions

It's simple. But it's real.

### The Atmosphere

Don't expect hotel silence. Expect life.
Whispers between bunks at midnight. Someone brewing tea in the morning for whoever's awake. A soft shuffle of blankets. Occasional laughter, occasional tears.

This is what communal rest feels like. A little messy. Deeply human. Intimate in the most ordinary ways.

Some nights you'll fall asleep faster than you thought. Some nights you'll lie awake, listening to breath, and feel strangely grateful you're not alone.
