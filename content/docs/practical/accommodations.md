Gone are the days of camping in the open field this winter, we’re moving indoors! We’re offering dormitory-style accommodations with bunk beds to keep you warm and comfortable after a full day of connection and exploration.

Our sleeping arrangements cater to everyone’s needs, including **FLINTA** (women, lesbians, inter, non-binary, trans, agender) and snoring-friendly rooms, so everyone can rest easy.

### Accommodation Highlights:

* **Budget-friendly Hostel Feel**: Get the full festival experience with the added comfort of being indoors, perfect for the chilly season.
* **Bunk Beds**: Snuggle up in your own bunk with a mattress. Just bring your bedding or sleeping bag for a cozy night’s rest.
* **Mixed, FLINTA, and Snoring Rooms**: Choose a room that fits your comfort, whether you prefer quieter spaces or don’t mind sharing with some snorers.
* **Community Atmosphere**: Our shared spaces help foster connection, even as you unwind for the night.

### Additional Information:

* **Indoor Facilities**: No porta-potties here, enjoy indoor toilets and showers for added convenience.
* **Electricity Access**: You can charge your devices indoors, but we kindly ask you to leave energy-heavy appliances at home.
* **Respect the Space**: Help us keep the dorms clean and pleasant for everyone.
* **Mindful Smoking**: Designated outdoor smoking areas are available for those who need them.
* **Campers/vans**: feel free to bring them, please let us know beforehand so we can save you a spot.

### What to Bring:

* **Bedding**: A sleeping bag, blankets, or your own bed linens and a pillow for your bunk.
* **Personal Essentials**: Toiletries, towels, your emotional support stuffed animal and anything else you’d normally pack for a hostel stay.

### Please Note:

Indoor space is limited, so while we want you to make yourself at home, we ask that you keep the shared areas tidy. Let’s all work together to create a harmonious, clutter-free environment for our winter adventure.
