## Our Philosophy

**Your image is yours.** Your consent to be photographed is sacred.

We take photos to:

- Capture memories for participants
- Document the experience
- Create an archive of our community

We do NOT:

- Post your image online without permission
- Share photos on social media
- Use your image for promotion or commercial purposes
- Allow third-party photography
- Force anyone into frames

**Your body, your image, your choice.**

## What Happens With Photos

## Consent-only photography — the rules

- **Ask first, clearly.** Get consent **before** the shot. Name who’s in frame and intended use (personal archive / private share / public post).
- **No bystanders.** No one else in foreground or background. Watch mirrors/windows/reflections.
- **No disturbance.** Keep it brief. No flash, no lights, no tripods. Don’t interrupt scenes, rituals, or shared spaces.
- **Consent is revocable.** A yes can become a no. If anyone asks, **delete immediately** — no debate.
- **Phone Nook.** When you’re not using your device, leave it at the **Phone Nook (charging & storage)**.

### Who Takes Photos?

**Official photographers:** 1–2 designated community members with clear cameras and consent badges

**Personal photos:** Allowed under the consent-only rules above.

**No phones during intimate/ritual moments:** We’ll announce phone-free spaces/times at Opening Circle.

---

### Photo Times

**We announce photo times clearly:**

- Before the Opening Circle
- During afternoon "jam spaces" (optional)
- At the play party
- Other moments as appropriate

**If we're photographing, we'll say so.**

You can:

- Step out of frame
- Say "no photos" to photographers
- Decline specific photos

**It's that simple.**

## Privacy & Consent Framework

### Opting Out of Photography

**You can opt out at any time:**

1. **Wear a "no photos" indicator** (badge or armband — provided at check-in)
2. **Tell photographers directly:** "I prefer not to be photographed"
3. **Opt out during consent moment:** We'll ask who opts out; you'll be noted
4. **Tell Consent Crew:** They can spread the word

**Photographers respect these choices immediately.**

---

### Photo Removal

**Changed your mind after the event?**

Email [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) with:

- Your name
- Which photos you want removed
- Brief reason (optional)

We'll delete them within 48 hours. No questions asked. No judgment.

---

### If You're in a Photo You Didn't Consent To

**This is a violation. We take it seriously.**

1. **Report it immediately** to [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) or a Consent Crew member
2. **The photo is removed immediately**
3. **We address it with the photographer**
4. **This is a boundary violation** — we take accountability seriously

---

## Personal Photography

### Can I Bring a Camera?

**Yes, with guidelines:**

**During play spaces:**

- You can bring a camera for personal use
- **Ask first** and get a **yes from everyone** in frame **before** the shot
- **No bystanders** (mind backgrounds, mirrors, reflections)
- **No disturbance** (brief, no flash/lights/tripods; don’t interrupt scenes/rituals)
- If you're playing, put the camera down

**During opening/closing circles:**

- Be present. **Phone-free during the circle itself** (put it away)

**Private moments:**

- Some people don't want to be photographed — **honor that**

**After the shot:** Offer to show it; **delete immediately on request**.
**Where to keep phones:** Use the **Phone Nook** when you’re not actively using your device.

### Videography

**Personal video is allowed under the same consent rules as photos.**

Get explicit consent before recording, just like you would for a photo:

- **Ask first, clearly.** Get consent **before** the shot. Name who's in frame and intended use.
- **No bystanders.** No one else in foreground or background. Watch mirrors/windows/reflections.
- **No disturbance.** Keep it brief. Don't interrupt scenes, rituals, or shared spaces.
- **Consent is revocable.** If anyone asks, **delete immediately** — no debate.

Videos can be shared under the same privacy guidelines as photos.
