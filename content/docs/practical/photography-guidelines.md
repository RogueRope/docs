## Why This Exists

People come to Bottoms Up! to be real — soft, ecstatic, messy, reverent. That kind of openness only happens when we know the room is safe. Cameras are welcome **only** when they honor that trust.

---

## Core Rule: Explicit Consent, Every Time

- Ask **before** you take a photo or video  
- Ask **everyone** in the frame — foreground, background, even blurry shapes  
- State how you intend to use it (personal memento? private album? might share later?)  
- Accept "no" immediately and without persuasion  
- Be ready to delete in the moment if someone changes their mind

_Blur is not consent. Assumption is not consent._

## How to Ask Without Disrupting

- Approach people when they’re not in the middle of a scene  
- Keep it simple: “Can I capture this for my personal memory?”  
- If it’s a group shot, get a verbal yes from **every** person  
- If anyone hesitates, treat it as a no  
- Put the camera away during sensitive rituals and consent moments

---

## What’s Not Allowed

- Bystander shots, candids of people you didn’t ask  
- Flash, loud shutters, or anything that breaks the scene  
- Recording audio without explicit consent  
- Using cameras in bathrooms, changing areas, or private rooms

If you’re unsure whether something is okay, skip it or check with an organizer.

## Respect the Space

The venue is part of our privacy. When framing photos:

- Avoid wide shots that reveal location details, signage, or maps  
- Crop or blur identifying features if in doubt  
- Never capture staff or community members who haven’t opted in

---

## After the Gathering

- Re-confirm with every person in the image before you share it anywhere  
- Keep the venue anonymous: no names, addresses, or identifiable architecture  
- Remove posts immediately if anyone asks you to delete them  
- Skip tagging people unless they explicitly request it  
- Treat community albums as confidential — no screenshots or forwarding without consent

---

## If Something Feels Off

Tell the Consent Crew or organizers right away. We’d rather have an awkward conversation than a broken container. Your instinct to protect the space is part of the culture here.
