## The Food Plan

**🍽️ What we provide:**

- **Coffee and water** — always available
- **Bread in the morning** — daily
- **Snacks** — most afternoons
- **Warm meal** — every evening

**🥗 Dietary choice:**
You'll choose **vegetarian** or **meat** when you register — and we'll ask you to stick with your choice so we can plan portions.

This is _not_ a gourmet weekend. But it will be tasty, filling, and made with love (and probably laughter).

### Sample Schedule — Subject to Change

Just to give you a sense of the rhythm. Times and offerings may shift based on our collective needs.
