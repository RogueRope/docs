# Food

## What's the general idea?

No need to bring a cooler this year! We have refrigerators available for storing your personal food items.

Each morning, we'll gather for a communal brunch. We'll provide the bread, coffee, and tea. Anything else you'd like on your bread, bring along and store it in our refrigerators to keep it fresh. If you need to purchase additional groceries, supermarkets are conveniently located within 2 km.

In the afternoon, we'll offer a light snack, such as hummus, salad, or ice cream. For dinner, we'll serve a warm meal, typically featuring a BBQ and the ever-popular frites-mobile.

While the camp provides basic sustenance, it's not an all-day buffet. So, if you enjoy cornflakes in the morning or like to snack throughout the day, bring your favorite munchies, nuts, granola bars, fruit, or chocolate bars. Customize your camp experience to your liking!

As a new addition this year, we'll have bread available throughout the day. Feel free to make yourself a sandwich whenever you please.

We offer **vegetarian** and **meat** options. When you sign up for a ticket, you will be asked to indicate your preference. Please note that to make the logistics of the menus work, you will need to stick with your choice.

Anything beyond vegetarian or meat diets is not within our current kitchen capacity. If you have very specific nutrition needs \(vegan, gluten-free, organic\), we are open to helping you, and can provide those with specific needs access to the kitchen. [Get in touch]({{< ref "/docs/practical/contact" >}} "Contact us") and we'll work something out.

As you can see, this is **not** a culinary event, but we're confident that, with your help, we can make this work. So, prepare your taste buds for some nice surprises.


## Summary : What to Bring Yourself?
* Snacks and treats (also to share).
* Your own drinks and sodas. Please note there will be **no bar** on site.
* As with drinks, provide your own favorite bread covering (cheese/meat/jam/vegan spread or even pindakaas)
