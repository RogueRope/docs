# Food

## What's the general idea?

No need to bring a cooler! We've got refrigerators available for your personal food items.

Each morning, we’ll come together for a communal brunch. We’ll provide bread, coffee, and tea. Want something extra on your bread? Bring your favorite toppings and store them in our fridge. Supermarkets are also nearby (within 2 km) if you need to grab anything.

In the afternoons, we’ll serve soup, bread, fruits, and veggies. For dinner, expect a warm meal like pizza or a visit from the beloved frites-mobile.

While we provide the basics, it’s not an all-day buffet. So, if you love a morning bowl of cornflakes or need snacks during the day, be sure to bring your favorites—think nuts, granola bars, or chocolate. This year, we’ll also have bread available all day, so feel free to make a sandwich whenever.

We offer both **vegetarian** and **meat** options. When purchasing your ticket, you’ll choose your preference, and we ask that you stick with it throughout the event.

For those with specific dietary needs (vegan, gluten-free, organic), we can offer limited access to the kitchen. If this applies to you, [reach out]({{< ref "/docs/practical/contact" >}} "Contact us") and we’ll see what we can do.

While this isn’t a foodie festival, we’re sure there’ll be some delicious surprises along the way!

## Summary: What to Bring Yourself
* Snacks and treats (sharing encouraged!)
* Your own drinks (no bar on-site).
* Toppings for your bread (cheese, jam, spreads, etc.).
