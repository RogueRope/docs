## The Gathering

**Is this just 5 days?** Yes. Wed 18:00 – Sun 16:00. That's 5 full days—long enough to truly settle in, short enough to stay fully present.

**What time do I need to arrive?** **Wednesday by 21:00 for the Opening Circle — this is mandatory.** You must be present for this foundational ritual. If you can't make Wednesday evening, this gathering isn't the right fit for you this year. Leaving early is fine, but arriving on time is essential. → Travel tips & Build Day details live in [Getting There](getting-there).

**Do I have to do rope?** No. Watch, connect, rest, or play. All of it's welcome.

**Is this sexual?** Yes. Sex-positive, sexual interactions happen. If seeing others kiss, touch, or express sexuality makes you very uncomfortable, this isn't your event. We're clear because consent is mutual.

**Will I know anyone?** ~30% come solo. You'll meet people. By day 2, you'll know folks. By day 4, you're part of something.

## Safety & Boundaries

**Consent framework?** Ask before touch. Respect "no." Check in during play. Continuous, not one-time. [Full framework →]

**Consent violation?** Find Consent Crew (identified at opening circle). You're supported first. We take it seriously. You're believed.

**First aid?** Yes, trained responders on-site. Hospital in Mol (~10 min).

**Overwhelmed?** Quiet spaces available. Find an FWB (support person). Rest, cry, leave if needed. Your wellbeing comes first.
