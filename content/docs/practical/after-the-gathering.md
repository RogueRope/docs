## First 48 Hours

Sleep. Eat. Hydrate. Move gently. Avoid big decisions.

Your nervous system is integrating. Expect tiredness, emotions, vivid dreams, sensitivity—all normal.

**Subdrop** (emotional low after intensity) is real but temporary. Signs: emptiness, disconnection, lethargy. If it hits: reach out to the community, call a friend, see a therapist.

**Crisis?** Call [national crisis line] or [kink-informed therapist referral]

## A Final Word

You came. You were brave.
You opened your heart. You met yourself and others.
You moved something real.

That doesn't disappear because you left.

You carry this forward now. In your body. In your relationships. In your understanding of yourself.

The gathering doesn't end. It transforms.

We'll be here — in our community spaces, at the next event, in the emails and memories and late-night rope sessions you share with people you met.

You belong in this community.

Welcome home.
