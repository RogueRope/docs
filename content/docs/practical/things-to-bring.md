# Leave No Trace

As it's an indoor event, we'll be handling recycling onsite. Please minimize the waste you bring, like plastic packaging from six-packs. We’ll have dedicated recycling bins this year, and we’re making an extra effort to recycle properly. Let’s work together to keep the space clean and contribute to a communal cleanup effort.
