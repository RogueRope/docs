## Saying Yes (When You Mean It)

A ticket isn't just entry — it's commitment.  
To show up. To co-create. To meet this intensity with presence.

Securing your spot at Bottoms Up! is simple — but we ask that you move slowly. This isn't just about clicking "buy." It's about saying yes, with your whole self.

## Step 1: Read This First

If you've made it to this page, you've probably explored the rest of the site. (If not, we lovingly encourage you to pause and wander back through the other pages.)

This isn't a spectator gathering. It's immersive. Real. Sometimes beautifully raw.  
We want you to arrive with your eyes wide open — excited, ready, and fully informed about what you're stepping into.

## Step 2: Reflect Before You Commit

Before you grab a ticket, take a breath.  
Ask yourself:

- Does this call to where I'm at right now?
- Will it nourish me — or stretch me too thin?
- Do I have the capacity (emotionally, physically, financially) to be fully present?

**FOMO is not a good reason to come.**  
You deserve more than that. And so does this space. This gathering asks for your full presence — not your anxious attendance.

Come because it's a yes in your gut.  
Not a maybe in your mind.

That might mean a sliding scale, a payment plan, work exchange, or creative alternatives.
