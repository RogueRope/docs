## Before You Cross the Threshold

Every one of us carries stories: heartbreaks, unresolved fights, jealousy, shame, grief, burnout.
That's human. It's also **volatile tinder** in a space like Bottoms Up!—where intensity, intimacy, and erotic charge run high.

Here's the truth:

> **Whatever you bring in—light or dark—will get amplified.**
> If it's wonder, the place will glow.
> If it's unspoken resentment, it can overflow into disruption.

This page is a loving caution. A reminder to **pause, scan, and sort** your inner luggage before you enter the space.

### Name It, Tame It, or Leave It

1. **Name It**
   - Say it out loud (to yourself, a friend, a journal): _"I'm still angry at X."_
   - Hidden baggage loves the dark; naming switches on the light.

2. **Tame It**
   - Do the pre‑work: therapy session, hard conversation, breathwork, long run—whatever helps you find steadiness.
   - If it can't be fully solved, at least give it a safe container.

3. **Leave It**
   - Some loads are too fresh, too sharp. That doesn't make you weak—just honest. If the weight feels un‑carry‑able, it might be kinder to sit this gathering out (or arrive later, in a different year).

### Relationship Storms & Drama Triangles

- **Arriving with tension?** Name it together first. Decide: _Pause it, resolve it, or postpone the gathering._
- **Love triangles & undefined connections?** Get explicit now. Vagueness becomes violence when the energy spikes.
- **Recent break‑ups?** If seeing this person tie someone else might rip you apart, love yourself enough to wait.

This gathering isn't therapy. It's not neutral ground. It's a **magnifier**.

### Respect the Shared Space

This space holds many bodies, many hearts.
Personal storms can swirl into collective weather.

- **Don't process loudly in public zones.** Find a quiet corner or schedule time off‑site.
- **Consent to unload.** Ask before dumping heavy feelings on someone who may be tapped out.
- **Use the support web wisely.** FWBs, Consent Crew, quiet spaces—they're resources, not emotional dumpsters.

### Common Baggage Types

**Recent relationship changes:** Breakups, new relationships, shifting agreements, or major life transitions can all destabilize your emotional ground.

**Unresolved conflicts:** Ongoing tensions with existing partners, friends, or community members will likely surface in intimate spaces.

**Past trauma:** This gathering can trigger unexpected memories or reactions. Come prepared with your coping strategies.

**Shame or insecurity:** About your body, your experience level, your desires, or your worthiness of connection and pleasure.

**Scarcity fears:** Around attention, desirability, or access to the kinds of connections you want.

### Self-Care Strategies

- **Do your emotional homework** before arriving
- **Bring trusted coping mechanisms** (breathing techniques, grounding practices, etc.)
- **Have realistic expectations** about what the gathering can and can't provide
- **Plan for integration time** after the gathering to process what comes up
- **Consider therapy or counseling** support before and after intense experiences

### When to Consider Not Attending

Sometimes the most caring choice is to wait. Consider postponing if:

- You're in acute crisis or trauma recovery
- You have unresolved conflicts with others who will be attending
- Your relationship system is unstable and can't handle additional stress
- You're using the gathering to avoid or escape unaddressed life issues
- You don't have adequate emotional support systems outside the event

This isn't rejection — it's wisdom. The gathering will exist again, and you can arrive when you're more resourced.

### Creating Boundaries

**Before arriving:**

- Identify your emotional, physical, and energetic limits
- Communicate clearly with partners about expectations and agreements
- Make plans for self-care and support during the gathering

**During the gathering:**

- Check in with yourself regularly about your capacity and comfort
- Communicate boundaries clearly and kindly to others
- Ask for what you need without apology or over-explanation
- Say no when something doesn't feel right

**After the gathering:**

- Process the experience with trusted friends or partners
- Notice what came up that might need attention in your regular life
- Integrate insights slowly rather than making major changes immediately

Remember: Boundary-setting is an act of care for both yourself and the community.

Kindly—and courageously—leave it at the door.
