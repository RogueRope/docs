## Care as a Way of Being

Consent isn't a question; it's the water we swim in.

This gathering asks a lot of you — emotionally, energetically, relationally. So we've built in care. Not just as a safety net, but as a way of being.

These pages are here to support you before, during, and after your time at Bottoms Up!. Whether you're feeling overwhelmed, excited, cautious, curious — you're not alone. We've thought about you.

### Consent & Support

- [**Consent & Safety**](consent-framework) — Celebrate the no, practice ongoing consent, and meet the Consent Crew
- [**Support & Care Systems**](support-care) — FWBs, bracelets, conscious care of space, and how we hold each other
- [**Neurodivergent Support**](neuro) — How we make space for different brains and bodies

### Emotional Preparation

- [**Emotional Wellbeing**](emotional-wellbeing) — Managing baggage before arrival and caring for yourself during the gathering
- [**Arriving with Partners**](partners) — Honoring existing bonds while staying open to emergence

### After the Gathering

- [**After the Gathering**](after-integration) — Immediate care, integration support, and staying connected

Read what you need. Leave what you don't.
These resources are here for your breath, your nervous system, your sense of safety — and your freedom to go deep, knowing you're held.
