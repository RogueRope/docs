Things may get chaotic at _Bottoms Up!_ interactions might feel intense, or you may feel a bit out of place without your usual comforts. It’s important to know that these feelings are normal, and there are plenty of ways to manage them!

### Some helpful tips:

* Be gentle with your body.
* Seek help if you need it.
* Clearly state your boundaries and communicate openly, whether you're talking with strangers or loved ones.
* Focus on having an experience that makes YOU happy.
* Connect with others in ways that make YOU comfortable.

## Seeking Help

If you find yourself needing support, we might be able to help. But remember, our volunteers are **not professionals** they’re dedicated community members doing their best. While we offer support, **we're not here to guide you every step of the way**. You need to find your own balance and navigate the experience that works for you. We’re always open for questions and will do our best to assist, but ultimately, your well-being is in your hands.

### Where to find support:

* **Peer Support**: Start by reaching out to friends or peers. They might be able to offer emotional, practical, or even medical support.
* **Consent Crew**: Focused on creating a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment, the Consent Crew can help with any issues related to personal boundaries, consent, or mutual respect. If needed, they can also mediate conflicts, as long as all parties are open to it.
* **Neuro-Liaison**: Our Neuro-Liaison is a resource for neurodiverse participants, providing tailored support. They also work with event organizers to ensure that everyone’s needs are considered. They can help mediate conflicts and assist in any way that promotes a positive experience for all.

## Personal Responsibility

It’s important to approach this event knowing that **you are responsible for your own well-being**. Our team will do their best to offer solutions, but they are not trained therapists or counselors. We operate on a “Rogue Rope” mindset: no blame or shame, just a focus on finding solutions. Whether you need a quiet space, someone to talk to, or a different approach, we’ll try our best to help, but it starts with you advocating for yourself.
