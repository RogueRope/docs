## Arriving with Partners

### Arriving Together

You're coming with someone you already share something with.  
That's beautiful.

Maybe it's a long-term partnership.  
Maybe it's new.  
Maybe it's undefined — a rope connection, a playmate, a lover, an anchor.

Whatever shape it takes: you already have some shared language. Maybe some shared history. Maybe shared boundaries.

This page is here to help you **stay grounded in that connection** — while still opening to the space around you.

### About That Bubble

It's natural to stick close when you arrive with someone you trust. Especially in intense, sensual, or unfamiliar spaces.

But intimacy doesn't have to mean insulation.  
And connection doesn't have to mean containment.

We invite you to stay open.
To soften the edges of your "we" — while still opening to the space around you.

> Try orbiting. Try weaving. Try being findable.  
> Let people know how you move: "I'm here with someone — and also open to new energy."

This isn't about splitting up.  
It's about **making room for emergence**.

### Playing Together

Whether you're tying, topping, bottoming, watching, or just breathing in sync:

- **Check in.** Even if it's familiar. Especially if it's familiar. Event energy can stir things up.
- **Tend to the space.** Public play creates atmosphere — be aware of how you're shaping it.
- **Plan for aftercare.** Bring a blanket. Leave space. Make time to land back in each other.

### Playing Separately

Some of you arrive with **non-monogamous agreements**, or **independent playstyles**. Others might discover desires at the event you didn't expect.

We celebrate that.

Some suggestions:

- **Have the awkward conversations early.** Agreements, boundaries, intentions — get clear before you get hot.
- **Don't assume symmetry.** One of you might explore more than the other. That's okay. Move at your own paces with care.
- **Plan for reconnection.** Not just physically. Emotionally, too. Even a 5-minute cuddle check-in can shift everything.

### If Things Get Wobbly

They might. That's not failure — that's reality.

Event energy is raw. Beautiful, but activating. You might feel:

- Protective
- Left out
- Jealous
- Tender
- Surprised by your own reactions

**This is normal.** Here's what helps:

- **Pause before reacting.** Take a breath, find some space, check your emotional state
- **Talk to your person privately.** Don't process in public or through other people
- **Use the support systems.** FWBs can help you sort through unexpected feelings
- **Remember your agreements.** Return to what you decided together before arriving
- **Be gentle with each other.** This intensity can bring up old wounds or new insights

### Relationship Configurations

**Monogamous couples:** You're welcome here whether you play only with each other or not at all. The gathering offers many forms of connection beyond physical play.

**Non-monogamous folks:** Great! Communicate clearly with existing partners and new connections about boundaries and expectations.

**Solo but partnered:** Coming alone while partnered elsewhere requires extra care in communication both directions.

**Single and exploring:** You're not expected to find a partner here, but if connections emerge, navigate them with the same care as everyone else.

**Relationship anarchists:** We love your approach to connection, just be clear about what you're offering and seeking.

And stay open to what's possible.
