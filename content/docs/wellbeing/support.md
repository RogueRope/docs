## FWBs: Friends With Benefits

_Yes, the good kind._

At Bottoms Up!, care isn't something the organizers provide.
It's something **we all create** — together, moment by moment.

This year, anyone can be an FWB. And we mean anyone.

### What Is an FWB?

**Friend With Benefits** = someone who's willing to show up for others.  
To hold space. To offer support. To check in. To notice.

Not all the time. Just when you feel able. Just when it's real.

FWBs aren't staff. They're **you**.  
And when you're ready to offer care, you show it by putting on a bracelet.

### How It Works

- **Bracelets = Consent to Care**  
  When you feel grounded and resourced enough to be available for others, slip on a FWB bracelet. That's your quiet signal: "I'm here if you need me."

- **No Pressure, No Performance**  
  You can take it off at any time. There's no expectation to stay "on" all weekend. Your own capacity matters just as much as anyone else's needs.

- **Anyone Can Step In**  
  This isn't a special role. It's a shared one. We all have moments where we can be the calm in the storm — and moments when we can't.

### Why We're Doing It This Way

Because **care can't be outsourced**.  
Because the orga team can't hold it all — and shouldn't.  
Because we believe in shared responsibility, not designated heroes.
**Because we want to see what happens when everyone at the event decides to care for each other.**

This bracelet system lets us flow in and out of service — with consent, clarity, and freedom.

### What FWBs Offer

FWBs are available for:

- **Emotional check-ins** and active listening
- **Grounding support** during overwhelming moments
- **Basic aftercare** — water, snacks, blankets, presence
- **Gentle guidance** for newcomers or anyone feeling lost
- **Conflict de-escalation** and helping people find appropriate resources
- **Just being a friendly face** when you need human connection

Remember: FWBs are peers, not professional counselors. We offer care within our capacity and knowledge, and we help connect people to more specialized support when needed.

## Emotional Wellbeing

### Emotional Safety Matters Just as Much as Physical Safety

Bottoms Up! can stir a lot.
Connection. Intensity. Joy. Tenderness.
And sometimes — disorientation, overwhelm, or loneliness.

Whether it's a hard conversation, a crash after a scene, or just missing the familiar rhythms of home… it's okay. You're not doing it wrong.

### A Few Things That Might Help

- Be gentle with yourself. Take breaks. Drink water. Cry if you need to.
- Listen to your body — and let it guide your pace.
- Set your boundaries clearly, and hold them with love.
- Say no when you need to. Say yes only when it's real.
- Focus on what feels _right_ for you — not what others are doing.
- Ask for help. Even if it feels awkward. Especially then.

### Common Emotional Experiences

**Drop/Crash**: After intense scenes or connections, you might experience a sudden emotional or energetic low. This is normal. Rest, hydrate, seek gentle company or quiet solitude as needed.

**Overwhelm**: Too much stimulation, too many choices, too much intensity. Find a quiet space, practice breathing, limit sensory input.

**Loneliness in Connection**: Sometimes being around many people can make you feel more alone. This paradox is real and valid. Seek one-on-one connection or comfortable solitude.

**Processing Emotions**: Experiences here can bring up unexpected feelings — old memories, new insights, complicated reactions. Let them move through you rather than trying to fix or analyze them immediately.

### When to Seek Support

Look for someone wearing a **FWB bracelet** when you need:

- A check-in or grounding moment
- Someone to listen without trying to fix
- Help connecting with resources or other support people
- Aftercare support following intense scenes
- Just a friendly presence when you're feeling alone

You can also always approach:

- A trusted friend or fellow participant
- A [Consent Crew member](/wellbeing/consent-safety) — they're the dedicated team for boundaries, repair, or if something feels off
- The organizing team if you need more structured support

## Neurodivergent Support

### Neurodivergence Is Welcome. So Is Self-Knowing.

Bottoms Up! welcomes the full spectrum of how brains and bodies move through the world.

Autism, ADHD, anxiety, PTSD, sensory sensitivity, dyslexia, executive dysfunction, social burnout, panic loops, self-medication…  
Whatever you're navigating — you're not too much, and you're not alone.

But we'll say this plainly:

**There is no dedicated neuro-support crew.**

There are no therapists, no designated liaisons.
Just a gathering full of people doing their best — including you.

### What That Means

- **You are the expert on your needs.**  
  We trust you to know what helps — and to bring it with you.

- **Support is peer-based and informal.**
  If you're struggling, reach out to someone you trust. That might be a friend, a partner, a fellow attendee.

- **Care flows in all directions.**  
  If you're able to support someone else, beautiful. If not, that's okay too. Don't overextend yourself to meet someone else's regulation needs. You don't have to.

- **The quiet space is open to all.**  
  No forms, no check-ins. Just a soft, low-stim place to decompress if the outside gets too loud.

### Resources We Provide

**Physical Accommodations:**

- Quiet, low-stimulation spaces for decompression
- Clear signage and information about space layouts
- Flexible participation — you can engage at your own level
- Access to basic sensory tools (earplugs, eye masks, fidget items)

**Social Accommodations:**

- No pressure to participate in all activities
- Multiple ways to connect (verbal, non-verbal, structured, unstructured)
- Understanding that social energy is finite and needs to be managed
- FWB support system for gentle peer assistance

**Communication Support:**

- Clear, direct communication about expectations and guidelines
- Written information available for reference
- Permission to ask questions and seek clarification
- Understanding that processing styles vary

### Self-Care Strategies

Bring what you need:

- **Sensory regulation tools** (noise-cancelling headphones, weighted items, textures)
- **Executive function aids** (timers, schedules, reminder systems)
- **Emotional regulation supports** (comfort items, grounding techniques)
- **Communication tools** (scripts for difficult conversations, clear ways to express needs)

Remember: Taking care of your neurodivergent needs isn't selfish — it's how you show up authentically for community and connection.

### A Note on Self-Medication

We understand that many neurodivergent people use various substances (prescription, over-the-counter, or otherwise) to manage symptoms and participate fully in life.

We ask only that you:

- Stay safe and within your known limits
- Remain able to give and receive consent
- Be honest about your capacity for various activities
- Ask for support if your regulation strategies aren't working

We don't police or judge how you manage your neurodivergence. We just want everyone to be able to participate safely and consensually.
