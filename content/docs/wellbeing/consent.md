**This is the short summary right here:** if it takes effort to convince someone to do something, if you feel like a salesperson of cellphone subscriptions: stop, pause, turn around and walk away. Don't settle for a "yes", go for the "HELL YES!", the "FUCK YES!" or at least the "OMG YES!". Trust us, you'll thank yourself later.

[Here's a video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqBQH1e7XwQ "Enthusiastic Consent!")

Also: learn to be thankful for a "no". This means the person feels fine with expressing their wants and needs. Thank them for their honesty and openness.

Consent is a **whole-body experience**. It is not just a verbal “yes” or “no” – it involves paying attention to your partner as a person and checking in with physical and emotional cues as well.

Consent is also **mutual** (both people have to agree) and must be **continuous**. You can stop at any time, you can change your mind, and just because you said yes to one thing doesn’t mean you have consented to anything else.

## Consent is Enthusiastic

From [Project Respect](https://www.yesmeansyes.com/consent/) We believe that everyone has the right to sexuality without violence and hence we believe that positive sexuality begins with **enthusiastic consent**. This means being as excited and into someone else’s enjoyment as we are excited and into our own enjoyment. Only yes means yes – and yes should come from an engaged and enthusiastic partner.

> “Consent isn’t a question. It’s a state. If, instead of lovers, the two of you were synchronized swimmers, consent would be the water. It’s not enough to jump in, get wet and climb out - if you want to swim, you have to be in the water continually. And if you want to have sex, you have to be continually in a state of enthusiastic consent with your partner.”

**Consent** and open communication are key to positive sexual experiences for everyone involved.

## Let us know! 

**Please**, if you have had issues with someone, seen red flags or witnessed inappropriate behavior of someone on the ‘going-list’, **let us know**.
You can use Fetlife messages or [contact the orga]({{< ref "/docs/practical/contact" >}} "Contact us") in some other way.
Feel free to use a pseudonymous account by creating a new mail address with protonmail/yahoo/fastmail/… 

Please describe the issues and propose a way for us to deal with them. Does this person need someone to work with them on their behavior? Could we assist in facilitating [restorative justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice)? Can they still attend but do we need to keep an eye on them? Can they attend if they promise not to interact with you? Or is the best solution for them not to attend the event?

We will assess the situation and try to think of the best solution, after which we will contact you to see if this solution works for you. No process is perfect, but we’ll try to find something that works for all involved parties.
