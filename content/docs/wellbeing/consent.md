**This is the short summary right here:** if it takes effort to convince someone to do something, if you feel like a salesperson of cellphone subscriptions: stop, pause, turn around and walk away. Don't settle for a "yes", go for the "HELL YES!", the "FUCK YES!" or at least the "OMG YES!". Trust us, you'll thank yourself later.

[Here's a video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqBQH1e7XwQ "Enthusiastic Consent!")

Also: learn to be thankful for a "no". This means the person feels fine with expressing their wants and needs. Thank them for their honesty and openness.

Consent is a **whole-body experience**. It is not just a verbal “yes” or “no” – it involves paying attention to your partner as a person and checking in with physical and emotional cues as well.

Consent is also **mutual** (both people have to agree) and must be **continuous**. You can stop at any time, you can change your mind, and just because you said yes to one thing doesn’t mean you have consented to anything else.

## Consent is Enthusiastic

From [Project Respect](https://www.projectrespect.ca/consent/) We believe that everyone has the right to sexuality without violence and hence we believe that positive sexuality begins with **enthusiastic consent**. This means being as excited and into someone else’s enjoyment as we are excited and into our own enjoyment. Only yes means yes – and yes should come from an engaged and enthusiastic partner.

> “Consent isn’t a question. It’s a state. If, instead of lovers, the two of you were synchronized swimmers, consent would be the water. It’s not enough to jump in, get wet and climb out - if you want to swim, you have to be in the water continually. And if you want to have sex, you have to be continually in a state of enthusiastic consent with your partner.”

**Consent** and open communication are key to positive sexual experiences for everyone involved.
