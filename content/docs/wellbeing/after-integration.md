## First 48 Hours

Sleep. Eat. Hydrate. Move gently. Avoid big decisions.

Your nervous system is integrating. Expect tiredness, emotions, vivid dreams, sensitivity—all normal.

**Subdrop** (emotional low after intensity) is real but temporary. Signs: emptiness, disconnection, lethargy. If it hits: reach out to the community, call a friend, see a therapist.

**Crisis?** Call [national crisis line] or [kink-informed therapist referral]

---

## First Week

### Community Debrief

We typically organize a community debrief call in the days after. Watch for details in the WhatsApp group and email.

### Photos & Memories

- Photos will be shared (check your email for access details)
- Respect privacy: treat community albums as private and never screenshot or forward without consent
- Want to post something publicly later? → The "After the Gathering" section of [Photography Guidelines]({{< ref "/docs/practical/photography-guidelines" >}} "Photography Guidelines") explains exactly how to do that (consent, anonymity, deletion on request)

### Connect with People You Met

Email [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) with names to facilitate. Reach out directly if you remember them.

### Journal Prompts

- What surprised you?
- What do you want to carry forward?
- How does your body feel?

## Integration Support

### If You're Feeling Lonely

The end of an intense gathering can feel isolating. The remedy is reconnection.

**What helps:**

- Join the WhatsApp community immediately
- RSVP for the monthly community call
- Reach out to someone you met (even a small message)
- Go to a local rope jam or kink community event
- Plan to attend the next gathering NOW (tickets often sell out)
- Get a therapist who understands rope/kink

**You are not alone.** The people you met are feeling this too. Many are reaching out. Meet them.

### If You're Struggling with Emotions

Rope events stir up feelings — fear, joy, grief, desire, vulnerability. This is part of the work. But sometimes the feelings are overwhelming.

**What helps:**

- Talk to someone (friend, community member, therapist)
- Move your body
- Practice grounding (feet on earth, 5-4-3-2-1 sensory awareness)
- Reach out to the community support channel
- Remember: feelings pass

**If you're in crisis:**

- National crisis line: [number]
- Text crisis support: [number]
- Go to an ER if you're unsafe
- Call a trusted person

**Kink-competent therapists** understand rope, BDSM, power dynamics, and consent. They can help you process safely. [Referral list]

### If You Experienced Harm

If something happened at the gathering that crossed your boundaries or violated consent:

**You are not alone. We're here.**

1. **Reach out to the [Consent Crew]({{< ref "/docs/wellbeing/consent-framework" >}} "Consent & Safety")** — they're trained in support and accountability
   - Email: [consent-crew@roguerope.be](mailto:consent-crew@roguerope.be)
   - Phone: [number]
   - In-person: [staff available at gatherings]

2. **What happens next:**
   - You're heard and believed
   - We support YOU first (your safety, your healing)
   - We work toward accountability from the person who caused harm
   - We don't force confrontation or forgiveness
   - We help you access additional support if needed

3. **Additional support:**
   - Trauma-informed therapists: [Referral list]
   - Crisis counseling: [Numbers]
   - Support groups for BDSM/kink survivors: [Links]

**You deserved better. We're committed to accountability and repair.**

### If You're Processing a Relationship Change

Sometimes rope gatherings shift relationships — romantic partnerships, friendships, or self-understanding.

**This is deep work. You might:**

- Feel closer to your partner (or want to leave)
- Realize something about yourself
- Grieve a friendship or dynamic that changed
- Experience unexpected jealousy or desire
- Feel alone or unseen in your "regular" life

**What helps:**

- Talk to your partner or friend (honest, vulnerable conversations)
- Journal about what's shifting
- Get support from the community (others have navigated this)
- See a therapist who understands polyamory/kink/relationship complexity
- Attend the next gathering (these events create lasting transformation over time)

## A Final Word

You came. You were brave.
You opened your heart. You met yourself and others.
You moved something real.

That doesn't disappear because you left.

You carry this forward now. In your body. In your relationships. In your understanding of yourself.

The gathering doesn't end. It transforms.

We'll be here — in our community spaces, at the next event, in the emails and memories and late-night rope sessions you share with people you met.

You belong in this community.

Welcome home.
