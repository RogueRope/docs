### Neurodivergence Is Welcome. So Is Self-Knowing.

Bottoms Up! welcomes the full spectrum of how brains and bodies move through the world.

Autism, ADHD, anxiety, PTSD, sensory sensitivity, dyslexia, executive dysfunction, social burnout, panic loops, self-medication…  
Whatever you're navigating — you're not too much, and you're not alone.

But we’ll say this plainly:

**There is no dedicated neuro-support crew.**

There are no therapists, no designated liaisons.  
Just a gathering full of people doing their best — including you.

---

## What That Means

- **You are the expert on your needs.**  
  We trust you to know what helps — and to bring it with you.

- **Support is peer-based and informal.**  
  If you’re struggling, reach out to someone you trust. That might be a friend, a partner, a fellow participant.  

- **Care flows in all directions.**  
  If you’re able to support someone else, beautiful. If not, that’s okay too. Don’t overextend yourself to meet someone else’s regulation needs. You don’t have to.

- **The quiet space is open to all.**  
  No forms, no check-ins. Just a soft, low-stim place to decompress if the outside gets too loud.

### Resources We Provide

**Physical accommodations**

- Quiet, low-stimulation spaces for decompression  
- Clear signage and info about how the venue is laid out  
- Flexibility to opt in and out so you can pace yourself  
- Basic sensory tools on hand (earplugs, eye masks, fidgets)

**Social accommodations**

- Zero expectation to attend everything  
- Multiple ways to connect: verbal, non-verbal, structured, free-form  
- Acknowledgement that social energy is finite and valid to protect  
- FWBs available for gentle peer support

**Communication support**

- Clear, direct guidelines you can reference in writing  
- Permission to ask for clarifications and repeat info  
- Understanding that processing styles and speeds vary

### Self-Care Strategies

Bring or arrange what keeps you regulated:

- Sensory tools (noise-cancelling headphones, weighted items, textures)  
- Executive function aids (timers, schedules, reminders)  
- Emotional regulation supports (comfort objects, grounding techniques)  
- Communication scripts or cards for tricky conversations

Taking care of your neurodivergent needs isn’t selfish — it’s how you show up authentically for connection.

## A Note on Self-Medication

We know some folks use tools — prescribed or not — to navigate the world more comfortably.  
As long as you’re mindful of **impact**, **boundaries**, and **consent**, we’re not here to police how you care for yourself.

That said:  
**If your choices are affecting others**, we’ll step in. Autonomy only works when it includes accountability.

---

## Be Real With Yourself

This gathering is raw, intense, and immersive.  
It can be magical. It can also be too much.

If you know you need more structure, more predictability, or more emotional scaffolding than this space can offer — **that’s okay.**  
Saying no is a radical form of care, too.

If you do come, come prepared. With tools. With a plan. With your own signals and boundaries.

Bottoms Up! isn’t designed for ease.  
It’s designed for truth.

And we trust you to meet it in the way that’s right for you.
