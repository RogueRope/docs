At _Bottoms Up!_, we welcome neurodiverse individuals and strive to accommodate their needs as best as we can. We encourage all participants to take responsibility for their own mental health and well-being while being mindful of others.

### Neuro-Liaison Support

If you're comfortable, please communicate your needs and preferences to our neuro-volunteers, who are here to provide support and ensure everyone feels included and respected. While our volunteers are **not professionals**, they are passionate community members committed to creating a safe, inclusive environment. If you're interested in volunteering as a mental health support person or neuro-liaison, we’d love to hear from you!

### Designated Quiet Space

We have a designated quiet space on site for when you need a break. This calm, distraction-free area is perfect for relaxing and recharging if things become overwhelming.

### Personal Responsibility and Safety

At _Bottoms Up!_, we aim for everyone to have a positive experience, but we emphasize that **each participant—neurotypical or neurodiverse—is responsible for managing their own needs**. We are **not a daycare**. This means ensuring you don’t put others at risk, either through your behavior or lack of self-care. We believe in creating a respectful and safe environment, and we will not tolerate actions that threaten others' well-being. Additionally, **concern trolling** (using fake concern to criticize or manipulate others) will no longer be tolerated in our space.

### Mutual Respect and Boundaries

We ask that all participants be mindful of their actions and how they impact others. Respecting boundaries and communicating clearly are key to maintaining a supportive environment. If you're unsure about something, please don’t hesitate to ask one of our volunteers or staff members for guidance.

Together, we can create a space where everyone feels valued, supported, and able to enjoy _Bottoms Up!_ to the fullest. Let’s learn from and support each other!
