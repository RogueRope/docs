At _Bottoms Up!_, we welcome neuro diverse individuals and strive to accommodate their needs as best as possible. We encourage all participants to take responsibility for their own mental health and well-being while also being mindful of others.

If you feel comfortable doing so, communicate your needs and preferences to our neuro-volunteers, who are here to provide support and ensure that everyone feels included and respected. Our volunteers are passionate individuals who are committed to creating a safe and inclusive environment for all participants. If you're interested in volunteering as a mental health support person or neuro-liaison, please reach out to us for more information on how to get involved.

We also have a designated space on site where individuals can go if they need some time to themselves or just want to relax. This spot is quiet and free from distractions, so feel free to take some time out if you need it.

At _Bottoms Up!_, we believe in creating a supportive and inclusive environment for all participants, and we're committed to making sure that everyone has a positive and enjoyable experience. **We require all participants, neuro-typical or not, to be able to take care of their own needs and not pose a risk to others.** We believe that everyone has the right to feel safe and respected, and we will not tolerate any behavior that puts others at risk.

We encourage all participants to be mindful of their actions and how they may impact others. We ask that you respect other people's boundaries and communicate clearly with them. If you're unsure about something, please don't hesitate to ask one of our volunteers or staff members for guidance.

We hope that everyone has an amazing time at _Bottoms Up!_ and that we can all learn from and support each other.
