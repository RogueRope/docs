At _Bottoms Up!_, we proudly welcome neurodiverse individuals and are committed to making our space as accommodating as possible. We encourage everyone to prioritize their own mental well-being while also being considerate of others.

As a social event, _Bottoms Up!_ thrives on connection, inclusivity, and shared experiences. We understand that this environment may feel challenging for some, and that's completely okay. While we do offer flexibility, including quiet spaces where participants can temporarily withdraw if needed, there are also some required activities where interaction is essential. If this level of participation feels beyond your comfort zone, we want to be transparent that this event might not be the right fit. We encourage an open mind and a willingness to engage with others to help foster meaningful connections.

### Neuro-Liaison Support

If you're comfortable, we invite you to share your needs and preferences with our neuro-volunteers. These wonderful community members are here to offer support and ensure that everyone feels respected and included. While they aren’t professionals, they’re passionate about creating a welcoming environment. If you'd like to join as a neuro-liaison or mental health volunteer, we’d love to have you on board!

### Designated Quiet Space

We know that things can get a bit overwhelming sometimes, which is why we’ve created a quiet, calm area where you can recharge. This designated space is distraction-free and perfect for taking a breather whenever you need it. However, please be mindful that this is a temporary space for regaining balance before rejoining the required activities.

### Personal Responsibility and Safety

At _Bottoms Up!_, we want everyone to have a positive experience, and we believe that starts with each of us taking responsibility for our own needs. Whether neurotypical or neurodiverse, it's important to be mindful of how we manage ourselves to ensure everyone feels safe. We’re all here to support each other, and that means avoiding any behavior that could put others at risk. 

### Mutual Respect and Boundaries

Respecting one another and being aware of our actions is key to keeping our community supportive. Clear communication is always appreciated, and if you’re unsure about something, our volunteers and staff are happy to help. Just ask, and we’ll be there to guide you!
