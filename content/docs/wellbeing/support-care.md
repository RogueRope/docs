## How Care Flows Here

Care at Bottoms Up! doesn't live with one team. It's a web: FWBs and friends, the Consent Crew, quiet spaces, conscious care of the venue, and organizers backing it all up.

Care isn't something the organizers provide.
It's something **we all create** — together, moment by moment.

This page shows you how the support systems work and how to plug into them.

## Friends With Benefits (FWBs)
_Yes, the good kind._

### What Is an FWB?

**Friend With Benefits** = someone who's willing to show up for others.
To hold space. To offer support. To check in. To notice.

Not all the time. Just when you feel able. Just when it's real.

FWBs aren't staff. They're **you**.
And when you're ready to offer care, you show it by putting on a bracelet.

This year, anyone can be an FWB. And we mean anyone.

### How It Works

- **Bracelets = Consent to Care**
  When you feel grounded and resourced enough to be available for others, slip on a FWB bracelet. That's your quiet signal: "I'm here if you need me."

- **No Pressure, No Performance**
  You can take it off at any time. There's no expectation to stay "on" all weekend. Your own capacity matters just as much as anyone else's needs.

- **Anyone Can Step In**
  This isn't a special role. It's a shared one. We all have moments where we can be the calm in the storm — and moments when we can't.

### Why We're Doing It This Way

Because **care can't be outsourced**.
Because the orga team can't hold it all — and shouldn't.
Because we believe in shared responsibility, not designated heroes.
**Because we want to see what happens when everyone at the gathering decides to care for each other.**

This bracelet system lets us flow in and out of service — with consent, clarity, and freedom.

### What FWBs Offer

When someone wears the bracelet, they're saying:

- **I can hold emotional check-ins** and really listen
- **I can help you ground** if things feel overwhelming
- **I can offer basic aftercare** — water, snacks, blankets, quiet presence
- **I can walk you through the space** if you're new or feeling lost
- **I can help de-escalate conflict** and connect you to other resources
- **I can be a friendly face** so you don't have to navigate a moment alone

FWBs are peers, not therapists or security. We help within our capacity and loop in the [Consent Crew](consent-framework) or orga when more support is needed.

### When You Might Reach for an FWB

- You're feeling wobbly and need grounding
- You need help navigating a tricky emotional moment
- You're not sure who to talk to about something that feels off
- You just need someone to walk with for a minute

FWBs aren't therapists or security. They're fellow participants.
If more support is needed, they'll help connect you with the [Consent Crew](consent-framework) or core team.

## Conscious Care of Space

### Care is not just what we do for each other —
it's what we do *with* each other.

Bottoms Up! isn't staffed. It's shared. That means the space only holds us as well as **we** hold it.

This isn't about being tidy.
It's about being *conscious*.
Of your body. Your stuff. Your impact. The people beside you.

### The Art of Noticing

You don't need a chore list. Just awareness.

- **Notice what's yours.**
  If you brought it — take it home. If you used it — clean it. If you dropped it — pick it up.

- **Notice what's off.**
  If something looks forgotten, lost, or misplaced, take initiative. Straighten it. Stash it. Set it aside safely. You don't need permission to help.

- **Notice the little things.**
  Wipe a surface. Carry a cup. Return a chair to its place. Small actions ripple.

- **Notice each other.**
  If someone leaves a trace behind — a cup, a shirt, a tool — offer a gentle reminder. Not judgment. Just care.

### We Are the Care Crew

You don't have to be a cleaner to care.
You don't have to be a "helper" to help.

Care isn't a task — it's a way of being in relationship with space, self, and others.

Let's leave every room better than we found it.
Let's make our messes part of the magic.
Let's take responsibility for what we touch, use, open, move, spill, or stir.

That's the kind of kink we're into.

**Care is contagious. Let's start the ripple.**

## Other Support Systems

### Emotional Wellbeing

Big feelings are part of the ride: drop, overwhelm, tenderness, loneliness, joy. [Emotional Wellbeing](emotional-wellbeing) explores what those waves can look like, practices that help, and how to lean on bracelets, friends, or quiet space when you need support.

### Neurodivergent Support

Different brains and bodies belong here. There's no dedicated neuro team, so we rely on peer care, clear info, flexible participation, and bringing the tools you need. The [Neurodivergent Support](neuro) page lists accommodations on site plus self-care strategies.

### Consent Crew & Orga

When something feels off, when a boundary gets crossed, or when you need backup for a hard conversation, the [Consent & Safety](consent-framework) crew is your first call. They coordinate with organizers as needed and can loop in FWBs or other resources.

### Quiet & Grounding Spaces

Need to downshift? The designated quiet zone is always available for decompression, naps, meditation, or simply less input. Conscious care of the space — tidying as we go, noticing what's needed — keeps those havens ready.

## How to Plug In

- **Ask for care** early; don't wait until you're underwater.
- **Offer care** only when you genuinely have capacity — bracelets make it clear.
- **Loop in support** (FWBs, Consent Crew, orga) when situations stretch beyond peer listening.
- **Keep an eye on the web.** If you notice a gap, name it; if you have an idea, share it.

You don't have to hold everything yourself. Let the system hold you, and feed it when you can.

## This Is How We Care

We're not building a support team.
We're building a **support culture**.

And it starts with trust — that you'll step up when you can, and step back when you can't.
That someone will see you. That someone will stay.

So if it feels right, slip on the bracelet.
And if you need care? Look for one glowing on someone's wrist.

We've got each other.
That's what makes this gathering work.
