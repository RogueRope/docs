## Dress Code: Creatures of the Night (Punk Neon + Blacklight)

We're stepping into a shared twilight — but with **punk electricity** running through it.
And yes: **we'll have blacklights**.

Not a costume party.
Not a runway.
A soft portal where you can arrive as yourself — or as the self that only comes out when the lights dim and the room feels safe.

Call it **Urban Mystics & Enchanted Souls**.
Or, if it lands better in your body: **Creatures of the Night**.
Tonight, add one more layer: **Punk Night Neon — made for UV**.

This is an **invitation, not a requirement**.

---

## The only real rule

**Dress for ease, for touch, for breath.**
Comfort is sacred. Movement matters. Softness counts.

Come dressed up, dressed down, half-dressed, overdressed, or in your favorite "I can finally exhale" outfit.
Nudity can be welcome. Never expected.

## Theme anchor: Punk Night Neon (under blacklight)

Think: **dark base + UV signal**.

Neon doesn't have to be loud. It can be a whisper in highlighter ink — until the room turns ultraviolet.

---

## The UV palette

- **Night neutrals:** ink black, charcoal, smoke, deep brown
- **Moon metals:** silver, pewter, chrome accents
- **UV / neon hits:** acid green, hot pink, electric blue, UV purple, safety orange
- **White details:** white often "pops" under blacklight (even small stitching, laces, logos)

---

## Blacklight-friendly textures & pieces

- **Fishnets / net stockings** (shadow geometry on skin)
- **Mesh** (mystery + movement)
- **Reflective details** (tape, piping, metallic thread)
- **Neon laces** (boots become a beacon)
- **UV-reactive makeup / nails** (small effort, huge effect)
- **Glow accessories** (bracelets, rings, hair ties — subtle or playful)

---

## Quick outfit formulas (blacklight edition)

1) **All black + one UV element**
   - neon belt, strap, scarf, nails, eyeliner, socks

2) **Fishnets + oversized top**
   - hoodie, sweater dress, long shirt, robe

3) **Ripped denim + nets + boots**
   - classic punk, zero effort, maximum vibe

4) **Harness over softness + neon detail**
   - knit/lace/satin + one bright strap or tag

5) **Black dress + boots + UV face detail**
   - one neon eyeliner wing, one glowing lip line, or UV dots

6) **Mask/hood + hidden glow**
   - quiet outfit, one "reveal" element when the lights shift

---

## Blacklight play (optional, but fun)

If you like the idea of "revealing" something:
- Write a tiny symbol on skin or fabric with **UV-reactive paint** (patch-test first)
- Add a **hidden neon message** inside a jacket, on a collar, or on the inside of a cuff
- Use **neon thread** to stitch one small sigil into a sleeve (DIY-level easy)

Keep it playful. Keep it you.

---

## Practical comfort (still sacred)

- **Layers.** UV rooms get warm. Hallways get cold.
- **Footwear you can stand in.** Boots, soft shoes, or barefoot-friendly options.
- **A "warm after" layer.** Hoodie, robe, big socks — for decompression.
- **Movement test.** Squat, stretch, breathe: does your outfit still say yes?
- **Snag test.** If you're around rope or close contact: avoid sharp/dangly bits that catch easily.

---

## If you don't want to dress up at all

Perfect. Choose one and you're done:
- Black loungewear + **fishnets**
- Pajamas + robe + **neon nails**
- Simple outfit + boots + **one UV accessory**
- Underwear + oversized shirt + **nets**

No one gets extra points here. Presence is the flex.

## Final note

We're not asking you to perform.
We're inviting you to **arrive**.

Come as a night-soul, a twilight-soul, a nervous little goblin, a velvet priestx, a gentle moth, a bored vampire, a soft beast —
now with **punk edges** and **UV signals**.

We can't wait to see who — or what — joins us.
