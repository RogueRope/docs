### Dress Code: Urban Mystics & Enchanted Souls

This year, we invite you to **step into the space** and emerge as your truest, most authentic self — a being of intimate connection, of soft lights and shared stories.

Our theme: **Urban Mystics & Enchanted Souls**.

Picture it: sophisticated mystics with velvet robes, enchanting souls with flowing fabrics, artistic spirits with creative accessories, intuitive healers with meaningful symbols. A gathering of beings who connect deeply — and never needed to pretend.

Let your attire reflect the person within — or the one you long to become.

### Archetypes to Inspire

**Urban Mystics**: Sophisticated and enigmatic. Velvet robes, crystal accessories, intricate jewelry, mysterious pendants. Maybe a tarot-inspired accessory or a single meaningful symbol.

**Enchanted Souls**: Light, ethereal, and a little mysterious. Flowing fabrics, delicate accessories, glowing threads. Are you a night-soul or twilight-soul?

**Creative Spirits**: Artistic, expressive, eclectic. Mixed patterns, unique accessories, personal treasures — vintage buttons, creative patches, meaningful trinkets. Nothing matches. Everything tells a story.

**Intuitive Healers**: Wise, nurturing, transformative. Soft cloaks, healing crystals, symbolic jewelry. Maybe a meaningful pendant or a small book of inspiration. You're here for connection.

**Night Poets**: Elegant or passionate. Silk scarves, artistic jewelry, flowing layers, comfortable yet expressive. Choose romance, creativity, or both.

**Shape-Shifters**: Mix everything. Different fabrics and textures. Layers that express your mood. Let your look evolve over time. Let no one define you.

**Dress for ease, for touch, for breath.**

### Comfort is Sacred

How much (or how little) you dress up is your call.
The space welcomes everyone — whether you're in elegant attire, comfortable loungewear, or creative expression.

We don't enforce this theme. It's an invitation, not a requirement.

And if you want to come as a purple hippo in a tutu? That's wonderfully expressive for us.

We can't wait to see who — or what — joins us.
