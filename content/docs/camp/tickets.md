Securing your ticket to our event is an easy process. Just follow these steps:

## Step 1: Familiarize Yourself with Our Event

Congratulations, you're already making progress! If you've reached this page, we hope you've taken the opportunity to read through our previous information to understand fully what our event is about. If you've skipped ahead, we encourage you to take a moment to review.


## Step 2: Complete Your Purchase

Once you've decided if this event is the right fit for you, you can proceed to purchase. Rest assured, we value your privacy and security throughout this process.
For legal/accounting reasons we need to ask for a name at the checkout process, feel free use your own, or not. 

[Buy your tickets here: https://shop.gogogonzo.be/RRC24/](https://shop.gogogonzo.be/RRC24/)

Once you've made the purchase we will review it, use your fetlife name during the ordering process. Once confirmed you will get an email with payment instructions.

Remember, the journey of connection and exploration at Rogue Rope Camp begins with this first step. We are excited to have you with us and look forward to the experiences we'll share.
