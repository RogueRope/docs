The essence of our rope journey **transcends the stage**. As we embrace the spirit of "[Tie like no one is watching]({{< ref "/docs/main/manifesto" >}} "Tie like no one is watching")", we invite you to experience rope as a medium for connection rather than performance.

This year at Rogue Rope, we celebrate **the spontaneous, the intuitive, and the deeply personal voyages** embarked upon through the ties that bind not just bodies, but hearts and souls. We honor each individual's path, whether as a rigger or a bottom, cherishing the beauty and strength found in surrender and trust.

**Forget the stage, the lights, and the audience.** Instead, we're curating moments of joy, encounters that may not be performances but are spectacles in their own right. The rope is our conduit to new situations, new connections, and the shared experiences that come from genuine, heartfelt encounters.

So, while you won't find a schedule of performances, you'll discover something more profound â€” a series of rope encounters designed to break the ice and initiate the first steps towards making a connection. There is nothing to perform, but so much to see and experience.

If you're moved to share your journey with rope, our content coordinators are here to facilitate these encounters. We're ready to assist you with any setups or spaces you may need to explore your rope narrative in the company of others.

In lieu of performances, **witness the myriad of personal stories unfolding around you**. Participate, engage, and let the rope guide you to new friendships and unforgettable moments. The stage is gone, but the space for connection is vast and welcoming. Come, let's weave new stories together at Rogue Rope.
