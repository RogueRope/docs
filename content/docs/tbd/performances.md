Welcome to the stage, dear friends! As Shakespeare once said, "All the worldâ€™s a stage, and all the men and women merely players." So, we invite you to step up and showcase your incredible talents, whether they're related to rope or not.

Are you a spoken word poet with a message to share? A dancer ready to take the floor and move us with your grace? Or maybe you're a magician with a few tricks up your sleeve, and a bunny in your hat? Whatever it is that makes you unique, we want to see it!

At Rogue Rope, we celebrate individuality and creativity, and we want to give you the opportunity to express your amazing talents. Take center stage and delight us all with your performances.

Please let our content coordinators at the camp know if you're interested in performing. Keep in mind that our shows may take place outdoors, adding an extra layer of magic to your performance. If you require music, bring your MP3 files on a thumb drive or provide a Spotify playlist. And don't worry, if you need any assistance, just reach out to us in advance, and we'll be happy to help.

So, the stage is set, and we're eagerly waiting for you to take it. Come and share your passions with us, and let's create unforgettable memories together.
