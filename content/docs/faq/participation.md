## I’d Like to Help out, but Honestly, I Have No Skills. What Can I Do?

At Bottoms Up!, [we’re all volunteers]({{<ref "volunteer.md" >}})
, and we always need more help! All of the Bottoms Up! participants volunteer in some capacity during, before, or after the event. Skills are less important than a can-do attitude and the willingness to work hard. Email [info@ropecamp.be](mailto:info@ropecamp.be) to offer more general help. Many hands make light work.

See the Volunteer page of this site.

## Can I Make Art?

Damn right! Bottoms Up! encourages participants to create and contribute art.

## But I Can’t Build Stuff or Make Art! What Can I Do?

Contribute in any way you can. You could cook, give manicures, massages, workshops or performances, and anything else that takes your fancy! 

Everyone has a valuable contribution to make.
