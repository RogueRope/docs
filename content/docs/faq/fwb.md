# Our Valued FWB's

We are immensely grateful for our devoted team of volunteer welfare workers who are committed to promoting the well-being, safety, and comfort of all participants. Their dedication and expertise are essential to ensuring a positive event experience for everyone.

## First Aid Support

In case of minor injuries such as bruises, cuts, and burns, our trained volunteers are readily available to assist you. They serve as third-line supporters, following a step-by-step approach:

1. **Self-Care:** Prioritize attending to your own needs - take a break, pace yourself, and utilize the public first aid kit provided for treating minor injuries.
2. **Peer Support:** Reach out to friends or peers, who may be able to offer medical, emotional, or practical support in times of need.
3. **Welfare Workers:** If you require additional help, don't hesitate to escalate your concerns to a welfare worker. They will be easily identifiable through specific markers (details to be shared).

## Consent Crew

Our dedicated Consent Crew is focused on creating a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment for everyone at the event. They are available to offer guidance on matters related to consent, personal boundaries, and mutual respect. If desired by all parties involved, Consent Crew members can also act as mediators to resolve any disputes or conflicts.

## Neuro-Liaison

The Neuro-Liaison serves as a specialized point of contact for neurodiverse individuals, providing tailored support and assistance. They work closely with event organizers to suggest improvements that cater to the needs of neurodiverse participants. Additionally, they are equipped to mediate conflicts and address concerns, ensuring a positive and enjoyable experience for everyone.
