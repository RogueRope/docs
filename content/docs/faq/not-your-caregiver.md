Everything you bring to the site has the potential to become **MATTER OUT OF PLACE (MOOP)**: costumes, water bottles, booze containers, inflatable chairs, hats, fruit, cigarette butts, even rope fibers can all become MOOP. Every person is responsible for their own rubbish.

So, remember what your caregivers taught you: don't litter, put away your toys after playing, clean up after yourself.
We don't clean up after you. **I am not your caregiver (but you can call me daddy).**

## What Should I Do with my Rubbish?

One of the fundamental ideas of Leave No Trace (LNT) is : **Pack it in, pack it out**. Everything you brought to Rogue Rope Winter, you will have to take away before the end of the event.

**NEVER LET MOOP HIT THE GROUND. Clean as you go. MOOP attracts more MOOP. When you see trash on the ground, pick it up and take it with you to dispose of it.**

* **Carry a MOOP bag**. Wherever you go, carry a small bag to collect any MOOP you find.
* **Weigh items down/don’t let them get blown away**. Anything that can blow away: put weight on it or tie it down. 
* If you’re a smoker, **carry a portable ashtray**, such as a mint tin, with you at all times. Or put butts in your pocket. **Never, ever drop butts**.
* Do not let bins overflow and MOOP get out of hand.
