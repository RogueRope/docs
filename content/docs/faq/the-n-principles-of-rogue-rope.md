These principles are a remix of the [burning man principles](https://burningman.org/culture/philosophical-center/10-principles/), [the hackerspace blueprint](https://hackerspace.design/) and some stuff we made up ourselves. Praise remix culture!

## Radical Self-responsibility

Rogue Rope encourages the individual to discover, exercise and rely on his or her inner resources. We don’t care about your hangups, or politics.  
You’re mental state is also your responsibility you are what/who you are, and what you consume.

## Solutions before shame

Shizzle will go wrong. This is a given, but let's focus on cleaning up the shizzle rather than blaming others.

For example: things will get dirty, and some people will be bothered by this more than others. Rather than playing the blame game if it bothers you so much, wait till the cleaning shift is over. If you feel the need to complain, or to let your inner Karen out, go to orga. See what happens. 

Empathy is encouraged. In this example, empathy from the people that don't mind mess towards the people that don't feel happy with it, but also from the clean freaks towards the people that don't mind it so much.

## Remix Culture

Everything is should free and open. if you don’t want something copied, adapted an redistributed. Shut your pie-hole and keep it to yourself. We don’t believe in the combination of ‘intellectual’ and ‘property’. Knowledge wants to be free.

## Communal Effort

Our community values creative cooperation and collaboration above competition and greed.

## Yes, you can!

We value constructive anarchy. We believe in doing rather than talking. Don’t ask, just do. If you fuck up, be sure to be able to reverse the stuff you did to the state it was before.

## Leave No Shit

If you use or borrow something, return it in a better state than when you received it.  
We are committed not to stuff the organizer with huge cleaning costs or efforts. The organizer isn’t our mum.

## Creative Capitalism

Money is not the root of all evil but keeps people alive and planes in the air. Money is  the stuff the enables corruption _and_ Greenpeace. Money is a way of keeping score, money is debt. Money is morally neutral. Cool people aren’t profit motivated, boring people are, _don’t be boring_.

## We accept patches

Rules are meant to evolve over time. We embrace remixes, we love your suggestions. The rules are up on [GitHub](https://github.com/RogueRope/Docs), submit your patches there. If you don't know how to do that, contact orga, we'll help you out.

## Consent: ask before you fondle

We want to create a setting where all parties participate in a physical encounter from a place of enthusiasm and autonomy. We believe a yes is yes.
