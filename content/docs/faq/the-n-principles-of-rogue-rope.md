These principles are a remix of the [Burning Man principles](https://burningman.org/culture/philosophical-center/10-principles/), [the hackerspace blueprint](https://hackerspace.design/) and some stuff we made up ourselves. Praise remix culture!

## Radical Self-Responsibility
Rogue Rope encourages individuals to discover, exercise, and rely on their inner resources. Mental states are personal responsibilities. Participants are encouraged to embrace who they are and what they consume without projecting hang-ups or politics onto others.

## Solutions before Shame
When things go wrong, focus on finding solutions rather than blaming others. Encourage empathy and understanding between different perspectives. Rogue Rope aims to create a space where people can lose themselves without fear of blame or judgment.

## Remix Culture
Everything is free and open. Intellectual property is not prioritized; instead, knowledge is meant to be shared and explored freely.

## Patches Accepted
Rules are meant to evolve over time. Embrace remixes and suggestions. Submit changes through [GitHub](https://github.com/RogueRope/Docs) or contact the organizers for assistance.

## Communal Effort
Rogue Rope values creative cooperation and collaboration over competition and greed. The community comes together to support each other and foster a positive atmosphere.

## Leave No Shit
Return borrowed items in a better state than when received. The organizers are not responsible for cleaning up after participants. Everyone should contribute to maintaining a clean and respectful environment.

## Creative Capitalism
Money is morally neutral and can be used for both good and evil. Focus on creativity and passion rather than profit motivation. Don't be boring.

## Consent: Ask before You Fondle
Create an environment where all parties participate in physical encounters from a place of enthusiasm and autonomy. Yes means yes. [See the Consent page on this website.]({{<ref "consent.md" >}})

## Yes, You Can!
Embrace constructive anarchy and action over discussion. Take initiative, but be prepared to reverse any changes if necessary. Encourage a proactive and engaged community.

One exception: don't start making up rules for others to follow, don't put up signs or make comments that appear to be from orga in the channels. I think tone and content of communication are very important and it annoys me tremendously if other people take this from me. My leadership style is hands-off but it's there nonetheless.
