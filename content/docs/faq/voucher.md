# Vouchers

## How will this work?
A 'voucher' is a unique code that you can use to buy a ticket.
If you registered as a couple, you will recieve 2 wouchers. If you registered as single last year, you will **also** recieve 2 vouchers

## Vouchers are personal!
If someone got a voucher for participating last year, and will not join us this year, the voucher is void. 
You **cannot** give or sell your voucher to your friends. When this initial pre-sale is over, we will distribute vouchers to people that joined the mailing-list.


## Waiting list
If you have a voucher, and all tickets are sold out, the ticketing engine puts you on a waiting list. 

## All sales are final, but...
You might be able to cancel your ticket), if there are people on the waiting list. You do this by [contacting us](contact.md). If we need to cancel and redistribute your ticket we reserve a 15% cancellation fee.
When this refund is done, another ticket will be distributed to the people on the waiting list (first come, first served).
