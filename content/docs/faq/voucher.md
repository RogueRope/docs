A "voucher" is a unique code that you can use to buy a ticket. You will get one when accepted after [registration](https://doplr.xyz/).

## Vouchers Are Personal!

You **cannot** give or sell your voucher to your friends. 

## Waiting List

If you have a voucher, and all tickets are sold out, the ticketing engine puts you on a waiting list. First come, first served.

## All Sales Are Final, But...

You might be able to cancel your ticket if there are people on the waiting list. You do this by [contacting us]({{< ref "/docs/main/contact" >}} "Contact us"). If we need to cancel and redistribute your ticket we reserve a 10% cancellation fee.
When this refund is done, another ticket will be distributed to the people on the waiting list (first come, first served).
