### Intro

Welcome to the **fourth** edition of Rogue Rope Winter, where we come together to learn, play, and grow. Our focus is on rope, but we also value self-organization and resourcefulness. This camp is entirely run by volunteers, so we rely on **everyone** to pitch in and help with tasks such as food preparation, building and maintenance, cleaning, and taking care of each other.

We believe that by working together and supporting each other, we can create a **truly special and memorable experience** for everyone. At Rogue Rope, we provide the necessary infrastructure to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable, including a space to pitch your tent, food and drink, suspension points for rope activities, a sound system for music and events, power and water, toilets and warm showers to freshen up.

However, it's the collective effort of **all participants** that make this event truly remarkable. From leading workshops to creating an inclusive environment, every contribution is appreciated and valuable. There are no spectators here, only participants. We see this camp as a playground, a blank canvas waiting to be filled with your ideas and talents.

Please note that Rogue Rope Winter is an intense experience and **may not be suitable for everyone**. We encourage all potential participants to carefully consider whether this event aligns with their interests and comfort levels. With that said, we welcome anyone who is eager to participate and contribute to the event.

Thank you for your interest in Rogue Rope Winter, and we look forward to having you join our group of passionate and dedicated volunteers. Let's create an unforgettable event together!
