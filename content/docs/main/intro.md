### Intro

Welcome to the second indoor edition of _Bottoms Up!_, where we dive deep into the sensory and emotional journey of the bottom in rope. While our summer camps have been open-air adventures, this winter **we’re bringing the magic forest indoors**. The core stays the same: a space to learn, play, and connect.

At Bottoms Up!, we’ve covered **the essentials**: a spacious indoor venue, cozy bunk beds, and of course, the ropes and suspension points that are central to our theme. Add in a sound system for ambiance and the basic comforts, and you’ve got the perfect setting.

But it’s the people who make this gathering truly special. Whether you’re sharing insights at our unconference, tying, getting tied, or simply enjoying the atmosphere, **your presence and energy** will make these days unforgettable.

This event can be an **intense experience**, and it might not be for everyone. It’s important for attendees to resonate with the spirit and intent behind Bottoms Up!. But if you’re eager to **explore, connect, and contribute,** we’re thrilled to have you join us.

What makes _Bottoms Up!_ unique is our **approach**. We’re **not** about stacking up new knowledge through workshops; instead, we focus on using the knowledge participants already have to create **deep, meaningful connections**. It’s about bringing your personal experiences into a shared space where we can explore new dimensions of trust, vulnerability, and understanding.

And yes, there's an undeniable **erotic dimension** woven into this experience. The trust, vulnerability, and power dynamics explored through rope create a rich space where sensuality and intimacy naturally unfold. Whether it’s through the physicality of tying or the emotional connection between partners, the energy in the room can be deeply charged, adding yet another layer to the Bottoms Up! journey.

Thank you for your interest in _Bottoms Up!_. We can’t wait to embark on this journey with our cherished friends. **Together, let’s create an event that resonates, connects, and celebrates the depth of the bottom’s journey in rope.**
