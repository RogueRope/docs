## Get to the Location

The site is in the province of East-Flanders. You can get there by car or public transport. The nearest train station is a 3-kilometer walk from the site. The nearest bus stop is a 1-kilometer walk away.

Our camping ground is 200 meters from the main road. **There is no parking on the camp site itself.** You can drive up, take out your bags, check in and then park your car **back on the main road**.
Take into account: you cannot drive your car onto the camping area! That is only accessible on foot. So, the last 40 meters or so, you will need to drag your stuff.

If you bring a camper or trailer, we **might** be able to put that on the field using our combined people-power. Important: if you plan to bring a van, camper, or trailer, **contact us to make sure there is some space.**

## Give the Greeter your Ticket with the QR code

You made it! Make sure to bring your order confirmation with your qr-code, so we can verify payment. Also double check that you're wearing white socks in sandals! You will get a [release statement]({{<ref "release-statement.md" >}}) to sign.

You will be asked to sign up for a shift of work... This could be cleaning up, going to the bakery or making sure the fire is hot. As you arrive, we will ask you to put your name down.

Now it's time to relax, set up your tent and share a drink with us!
