_Bottoms Up!_ is excited to welcome the colder months with a cozy, intimate atmosphere that focuses on connection through rope, bonds, and shared experiences:

### Cozy Indoor Encounters

- Our indoor venue offers a warm, inviting space, perfect for deepening connections and creating new experiences.
- There's plenty of room for rope play with our suspension points and spacious layout, ensuring we can continue to enjoy what we loved about summer, even indoors.

### Peer-to-Peer Discovery

- We emphasize learning through **peer rope exploration** and sharing knowledge without pressure or expectations.
- Our focus is on connection and how rope can deepen bonds beyond just technique.

### Collaborative Learning Spirit

- At Bottoms Up! Winter, we create a supportive environment where everyone can grow and learn together, free from commercial interests.

### Embracing Eros

- We encourage the exploration of sexuality as part of the shibari experience, maintaining the authentic spirit of rope play.
- Eros is an essential part of our event, allowing participants to explore and express themselves fully through their rope practice.

Join us for an experience that’s all about connection, learning, and expressing the art of shibari in an open and authentic way.
