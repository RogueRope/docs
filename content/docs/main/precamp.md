description: >
  Very simple: no-one is employed, every participant pays for their ticket. 
  We're in this boat together and we can make it conquer the seas or make it crash into a big iceberg. 
  It's really up to us.
lead: We need you to volunteer!

From Monday till wednesday at noon we will build up the campsite for the event.

There's room for 20 people to build.

Not just for big/strong people, lots of things on the todo-list, everyone can help.
