  Very simple: no-one is employed, every participant pays for their ticket. 
  We're in this boat together and we can make it conquer the seas or make it crash into a big iceberg. 
  It's really up to us.
lead: We need you to volunteer!

Get ready to roll up your sleeves and join us in building up the campsite for our incredible event! From Monday until Wednesday at noon, we're looking for 20 people to help bring our vision to life.

But wait, this isn't just for the big and strong! We have a long to-do list that includes a wide range of tasks, so there's something for everyone. Whether you're handy with a hammer or have a knack for creative problem-solving, we need your help to make this event a success.

And here's the best part: volunteering to build up the campsite is a fantastic way to meet new people and get a flying start to the event. You'll work side-by-side with a group of like-minded individuals, all dedicated to making this the best event possible. Plus, you'll get to exercise your creativity and see your ideas come to life.
