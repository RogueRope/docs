At Bottoms Up!, we’re all about making sure everyone feels welcome, while still sticking to the core idea of self-reliance and mutual respect. We’re here to help remove barriers where we can, but the event itself stays true to its vibe and operates under the same rules for everyone.

## Financial Accessibility

Money shouldn’t keep you from joining us. If finances are tight, let’s chat. Whether it’s a payment plan or pay-what-you-can, we’ll figure out a way to make sure you can be part of the event.

## Mental Wellness Consideration

We know Bottoms Up! can get intense, and it’s okay if that feels a bit much sometimes. Take care of yourself, be mindful of your boundaries, and reach out to others if you need support. Ultimately, your well-being comes first, but self-care is a big part of the experience too.

## Discrimination-Free Zone

At Bottoms Up!, discrimination has no place. We stand for a community where LGBTQ+ individuals, people of all ethnicities, ages, and abilities feel safe and valued. You are welcome here, exactly as you are, and we strive to create an environment where you can fully be yourself, free from fear or judgment.

## Wheelchair Accessibility

We're committed to ensuring Bottoms Up! is accessible to everyone, including wheelchair users. The event space is designed to accommodate wheelchairs with smooth access to all key areas. 

- **Toilets and Showers**: There are accessible toilets and showers available on-site to ensure everyone’s comfort. 
- **Sleeping Arrangements**: If you require a wheelchair-accessible sleeping area, please let us know in advance so we can reserve a suitable space for you. We're here to ensure your experience is comfortable, inclusive, and fun.

## Tailoring the Experience to Your Needs

We want to make the event accessible, but self-reliance is important too. If you need something specific to help you participate, let us know as early as possible. We’ll do our best to accommodate, but the event will run under the same guidelines for everyone.

## Support for Neurodiverse Attendees

We know not everyone processes things the same way, and that’s totally fine. If you need a little more clarity or something’s unclear, just ask! We’re here to support you, but self-advocacy is encouraged to make sure your needs are met.

Bottoms Up! is about creating a space where everyone can join in while still maintaining the event’s core spirit. Let’s make it a place where everyone feels they belong.
