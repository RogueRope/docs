## Financial Accessibility

We believe that financial constraints shouldn't prevent anyone from experiencing Bottoms Up! If the cost is a barrier for you, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're committed to finding a solution that works for you, whether that's a payment plan or a pay-what-you-can ticket. Let’s talk and make it possible for you to join us.

## Mental Wellness Consideration

Bottoms Up! can be an intense experience, and we understand that it might feel overwhelming for some. That’s why we’ve set aside an open day on Sunday—a lighter, more relaxed day designed for those who prefer a shorter, less immersive experience. Join us for just a day to enjoy the vibe without the worry of burnout.

## Discrimination-Free Zone

At Bottoms Up!, discrimination has no place. We stand for a community where LGBTQ+ individuals, people of all ethnicities, ages, and abilities feel safe and valued. You are welcome here, exactly as you are, and we strive to create an environment where you can fully be yourself, free from fear or judgment.

## Wheelchair Accessibility

We're committed to ensuring Bottoms Up! is accessible to everyone, including wheelchair users. The event space is designed to accommodate wheelchairs with smooth access to all key areas. 

- **Toilets and Showers**: There are accessible toilets and showers available on-site to ensure everyone’s comfort. 
- **Sleeping Arrangements**: If you require a wheelchair-accessible sleeping area, please let us know in advance so we can reserve a suitable space for you. We're here to ensure your experience is comfortable, inclusive, and fun.

## Tailoring the Experience to Your Needs

Your comfort and participation matter to us. If there's something specific that would make it easier for you to attend or enjoy the event, let us know. We're always eager to learn and accommodate wherever possible. If we can make it happen, we will. Reach out to us at [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) with your needs or suggestions.

## Support for Neurodiverse Attendees

We recognize that everyone processes information differently, and we’re here to help. While we strive to be as clear as possible, we ask neurodiverse participants to reach out if something is unclear or confusing. Please don’t hesitate to ask questions or seek clarity at any point—we’re here for you, but we also encourage self-advocacy to ensure we meet your needs.
