## Financial Accessibility

We believe that financial constraints shouldn't prevent anyone from experiencing Bottoms Up! If the cost is a barrier for you, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're committed to finding a solution that works for you, whether that's a payment plan or a pay-what-you-can-ticket. Let's talk and make it possible for you to join us.

## Mental Wellness Consideration

Bottoms Up! is an intense experience, and we understand it might be too much for some. That's why we've designated an open day on Sunday - a lighter, more relaxed day designed for those who prefer not to dive into the full event or might feel overwhelmed by long durations. Join us for just a day to savor the experience without the worry of exhaustion.

## Discrimination-Free Zone

At Bottoms Up!, discrimination has no place. We stand for a community where LGBTQ+ individuals, people of all ethnicities, ages, and abilities feel safe and valued. We strive to create an environment where you can be your authentic self, without fear or reservation.

## Tailoring the Experience to Your Needs

Your comfort and participation are important to us. If there's something specific that would enable you to attend or enjoy the event more fully, let us know. We're eager to learn and accommodate wherever possible. Accessibility, interpretive services, or any other needs - if we can make it work, we will. Reach out to us at [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) with your needs or suggestions.

Let's make Bottoms Up! a space where everyone belongs and thrives.
