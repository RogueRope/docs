## Step 2: Do the registration thing. 

As some of you may already be aware, we have been organizing an annual event known as Rogue Rope Camp for several years now. In the past, we have had a relaxed approach towards the selection of participants, as long as they were not a threat to the safety of others. However, we have decided to change the way participants are selected this year.

Going forward, participation in Rogue Rope Camp will be considered a privilege, not a right. We aim to create a great event, and for that, we require individuals who not only prioritize safety but also contribute positively to the community. Therefore, we have delegated the selection process to a panel of five trusted individuals from different geographic areas. These individuals are well-versed in RRC culture and possess valuable insights into the scene and the community.

The panel members will remain anonymous. Hans will not participate in the judging process.

> "For some people, the registration process is scary: you state what you want and what you offer. You might get a yes or a no. If this makes you uncomfortable, you're probably not ready for the consent negotiations you need to do at camp."

We have published the [guidelines and registration for Rogue Rope Camp](https://doplr.xyz/guidelines.php). These guidelines will serve as a code of conduct and will also guide the judges in their decision-making.

We understand that some may have concerns with this new process. However, we want to reiterate that participation in Rogue Rope Camp is a privilege, not a right.

The judges will evaluate individuals based on their ability to  make positive contributions to the community and their compatibility with other participants. If your application is declined, please understand that various factors go into the decision-making process.

Thank you for your understanding.
