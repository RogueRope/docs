At Rogue Rope, we like to keep things simple, fun, and community-driven. While we’re not a registered non-profit, we operate as a hobby collective, aiming to bring people together for good times and meaningful connections. Our structure is casual, with no formal staff or hierarchy. Instead, everyone who takes on a role within the group does so voluntarily, without compensation. We’re here for the shared experience, not for profit.

## Chipping In  
We keep costs low by encouraging everyone to contribute in ways that feel good for them—whether it's helping set up, offering emotional support, or sharing any specific skills you might have. Your contributions, whether physical or emotional, are always appreciated. These gifts keep Rogue Rope alive, and we're deeply thankful for everyone who chips in.

## No "Staff" Here  
You won’t find anyone to "Karen" here. We don’t have staff members, just participants. We see you as an essential part of the experience, not as a customer. Your role here is about engagement and connection. Think of Rogue Rope as a collective effort, where everyone’s participation is equally valuable.

## A Space for Everyone  
At its core, Rogue Rope is about fostering connections. By embracing the spirit of giving, sharing, and participation, we create a welcoming, inclusive environment where everyone can feel empowered to play a part in making the magic happen. There's no pressure, just the joy of being in a space where your presence and contributions matter.
