At Bottoms Up!, we’re all about transforming the traditional idea of learning. Instead of offering formal, structured workshops, we’ve embraced *Playshops*—spaces designed for shared, meaningful experiences. Now, we’re not dismissing the value of workshops—there are plenty of events that do them well, especially in non-erotic settings. Workshops can be great for your brain. But here, we’re focused on something a little different—something for the soul.

## Work vs. Play: A Comparison
|  | **Work** | **Play** |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Transfer** | Knowledge | Experiences |
| **Reward** | Later | Immediate |
| **Goal** | Brain-focused knowledge transfer | Soulful, connective interactions |
| **Setup** | Centralized around an expert | Co-created by the group |
| **Vibe** | Non-erotic, educational | Fun, spicy, and experience-driven |
| **Participation** | Passive audience | Active, engaged participants |
| **Structure** | Pre-determined, rigid | Fluid, adaptable |
| **Focus** | Skill-building | Emotional connection and joy |
| **Energy** | Serious, task-oriented | Playful, lighthearted |
| **End Result** | New skills or knowledge | Lasting memories and connections |
| **Duration** | Set time limits | Organic flow, more flexible |
| **Tone** | Formal, instructional | Relaxed, community-driven |


### From Learning to Experiencing  
Workshops are fantastic if you're looking for structured learning—they give your brain the chance to absorb new information, often from a central expert. But *Playshops* are about something deeper. Instead of focusing on what you’re learning, we focus on how you're experiencing it. The goal isn’t to master a technique or gather new skills, but to create a space where meaningful connections and shared joy take center stage. This is learning for the soul.

### It’s a Party, Not a Lecture  
We like to spice things up by turning our events into experiences that feel more like a party than a retreat or convention. Sure, there’s always something to learn, but that’s not the main goal. We want people to show up because they’re ready to have fun, feel good, and connect with others. The focus is on being present, exploring together, and enjoying yourself in a playful, erotic environment.

### Why Meaningful Experiences Matter  
At *Playshops*, the experiences we share as a group are what make them special. While a workshop might teach you a new skill, a *Playshop* gives you something more—an emotional connection, a moment of joy, and the freedom to explore in a relaxed, supportive environment. It’s less about feeding the brain and more about nourishing the soul.

## Come for the Experience  
We want people to come because they want to have a good time and create lasting memories, not just tick off a box for personal growth or skill-building. *Playshops* are for those who crave meaningful, soulful connections and experiences, without the pressure of formal learning. This is about participating fully, having fun, and leaving with more than just new knowledge—you leave with a fuller heart.
