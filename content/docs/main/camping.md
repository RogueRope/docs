We'll distribute electricity on the campsite, if you want to get hooked up bring the longest extension cord you have and a power strip. This way you can charge your mobile devices while you sleep.

Don't connect power hungry devices to to camping grid like fridges, hair dryers, airconditioning or dishwashers.

Let's hope for good weather, but if it rains, **do not dig a trench around your tent**. We want to leave the field in the same condition as we've found it.

Other stuff to bring:

* Your Christmas lights!  Or other cool led strips. Let's make it funky at night.
* Toilet/shower facilities are indoor, basics, 3 toilets and one urinal, so no smelly Dixie-toilets. 
* No need to bring dodgy gas stoves or other cooking gear, we will provide you with warm food.
* Please try to limit smoking on the camp-site, fire safety is important. Keep it clean! Trow your butts in the designated ash trays.
* If your smoke smells a bit funny, that's fine, no need to hide it in your tent.
* A box cooler, or one of those supermarket insulation bags.

## Is there a possibility to sleep indoors?

There is some room inside but we'll use this for activities.
