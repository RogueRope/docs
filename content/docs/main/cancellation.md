## Cancellation

If the event is not legal under Belgian or local laws (due to Covid waves/Putin/...), it shall not take place. In this case, everyone will receive a **full refund** for all costs \(tickets, drink vouchers\). No hidden fees will be deducted. If you paid X euros, we'll send you your X euros back via bank transfer.


## Personal Cancellation

If you can't attend for personal reasons \(sickness, change of plans, ... \) you can resell or gift your tickets. In this case, let the organizers know, so we can vet the person you want to sell your ticket to. Every participant needs to be confirmed by the orga. There is no point in selling your ticket to someone who won't be allowed to participate. So, first send an email to the orga, with your friend's FetLife name and email. We will send you both an email with instructions on how to proceed.
If you don't know anyone to take your ticket off your hands, and we have people on the waiting list, you can get a refund of 90% of the ticket price. If we don't have people on the waiting list, we can't make any refund promises but we will do our best to cut you a deal. Also in this case [contact the orga]({{< ref "/docs/main/contact" >}} "Contact us").

## Orga Cancellation

In case something happens that forces us to cancel the camp, you will get a full refund.

## Early Termination of the Event

If the event has started but has to be terminated early, due to harsh weather, acts of nature or other conditions beyond our control, the ticket price is not refundable.
