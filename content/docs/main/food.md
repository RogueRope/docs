# Food


We provide **vegetarian** and **meat** options, anything beyond that is not within the current capabilities of the kitchen. You are asked to make this choice when you sign up for a ticket. Note that people who've signed up as meat-eater are not allowed to eat the veggie stuff if it looks better!

If you have very specific nutrition needs \(vegan, gluten-free,organic\), I'm very sorry but this event does not have the human resources or capabilities to cater to you. We are open to help you though, and can provide those with specific needs access to the kitchen. [Get in touch]({{< ref "/docs/main/contact" >}} "Contact us") to work something out.

We will also provide coffee, sparkling and still water free of charge for all participants.

As you can see, this is **not** a culinary event, but we're lucky that Rob our *chef de cuisine extraordinaire* will join us for another time. So prepare your taste buds for some nice surprises. 


## What to bring yourself?
* You bring your cooler, we will provide ice cubes!
* You need to bring your own booze and soda.
* Breakfast: bring your own favorite bread covering (cheese/meat/jam or even pindakaas). Put it in your cooler, and we'll provide the ice to keep it cool. We'll send someone to the bakery for fresh bread every morning.
* No worries, We provide snacks in the afternoon and warm food every evening.
* Long story short, for the lazy people: bring a case of beer and a pot of Nutella, and you'll be fine.

**At the bar:** Last year we provided a bar for all attendees, this was a hassle, in the end most people brought their own drinks. Let's keep this up! Bring your cooler filled with your favorite drink, we will provide ice-cubes free of charge to keep it chilled.

**Breakfast:** Like with the drinks, provide your own favorite bread covering (cheese/meat/jam or even pindakaas). Put it in your cooler, and we'll provide the ice to keep it cool. We'll send someone to the bakery for fresh bread every morning.
