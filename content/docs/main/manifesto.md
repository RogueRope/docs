# The "Tie Like No One's Watching" Manifesto

At the heart of our gathering, we cherish the ties that bind n**ot just bodies, but hearts and souls**. "Tie like no one is watching" embodies the intimate essence of our rope journey. It is an invitation to engage with rope not as a performance for onlookers, but as a medium for deep, personal connection.

Rope becomes our language; it weaves stories of silent dialogues, emotional confessions, and the tender interplay of trust and vulnerability. While technical skills and workshops are valuable, they serve as mere starting points. The true art of rope lies in the **spontaneous moments, the intuitive touches, and the personal voyages** we embark upon with our partners.

Our space is a sanctuary for all — a place where every individual, regardless of background or gender identity, can forge meaningful connections. We honor the path of the bottom with the same reverence as the rigger, acknowledging the beauty and strength in surrender and trust.

Sometimes there's a pull towards the conventional, a lure of the '**knowledge exchange**' where passively listening gives an illusion of productivity, of being busy in a beneficial way. But let's ponder – **how much do we truly retain from days of intense workshops**? Often, it feels like productivity porn, a hustle to feel we're gaining, learning, advancing. 

Yet, this path can sometimes lead to a misguided equation: rope = workshops. If that's the sum total, **we're missing the point**.

Knowledge sharing has its place, sure, but **what people crave is connection, experiences**. _Bottoms Up!_ aligns with the practices we've nurtured – no high-profile tutors on posters, no separate billing. Everyone is a participant, an equal part of the whole.

What we aim for is to create an environment where people encounter new situations, fostering connections through these shared experiences. We're not selling workshops or peddling knowledge – we're curating moments of joy. The rope is merely a conduit.

We envision a series of rope encounters, **experiences designed to break the ic**e, to initiate those first, often daunting, steps towards making a connection. Everyone talks a big game, but the reality is that making that initial contact is a universal struggle, despite the fact that we all come to these events seeking connection.

**Let's focus on that – the genuine, heartfelt encounters that happen when people come together, bound by rope.**
