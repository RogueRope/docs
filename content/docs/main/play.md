## Inclusive Rope Revelry

At the core of our gathering is rope play—an open invitation to everyone who wants to explore the topes, no matter your skill level. This event is designed with that theme in mind.

We’re breaking down the myth that you need to be an expert to join the Rogue Rope festivities. Expertise isn’t a requirement—just bring your curiosity and enthusiasm. Whether you’re mastering the basics, eager to expand your skills, or looking for guidance as you explore new techniques, you’re in the right place.

Newcomers are as valued as seasoned pros; every journey begins with a single knot.

Here, there’s no competition—our ties are for connection, not for triumph.

## A Spectrum of Sensations

* Our playground is diverse and welcoming to all expressions of play: whips, canes, chains, needles, even fire—if it’s part of your play, it’s welcome here.
* We celebrate the bare and the bold. Nudity and sexuality are embraced, woven into the fabric of our vibrant community.

## Zoned for Comfort

* To cater to the diverse preferences and comfort levels of our attendees, we’ve thoughtfully created different zones within our space.
* Each zone offers a unique atmosphere, from quiet and contemplative spaces to more dynamic and interactive areas.
* You can move through these zones, finding the spaces that feel right for you, ensuring a safe, consensual, and enjoyable experience for everyone.
