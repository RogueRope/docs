## Rope play

Traditionally we welcome rope play of _any_ level. There's this misconception that you have to be good with ropes to partake in Rogue Rope events. Don't know how this started, but want to stress this is _not_ the case. Everyone is welcome, everyone that wants to play with ropes should feel free to come and learn. Also if your rope handling is basic, and you're happy with it and not interested to learn more, that's fine.

But if you want to try new stuff and have someone spot you, that's fine as well.

Everybody started from zero, and we're always interested in learning to know new people.

People that see tying as a competition have already lost it.

## Other play

* Other play is welcome: whips, canes, chains, duck-tape, blood, fire. 
* We're not afraid of nudity or sex, the plan is to improvise a play room as well.
* Golden showers and scat are hard to do in a 'clean' way at the camp, so we'll need to draw the line there.
