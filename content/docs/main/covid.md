One aspect that is still under scrutiny is the speed of vaccinations, let's see how that goes and if there are any differences for activities where **everyone** is vaccinated. We don't want to take positions on that right now, but chances are if there's a large benefit for activities where everyone is vaccinated we might want to take that option.

To give you some idea, we take the situation seriously and operate within the boundaries set by the law. This is **not** an illegal gathering.

## Protocols (info from 2020, needs update)

We're following 2 protocols:

The first one is the protocol for events. These were tightened 26/7, lowering the capacity to 100 people inside and 200 outside, which is well beyond our capacity of 49. We did the [official event scan](https://www.covideventriskmodel.be/) and we got a green label.

The second protocol is related to sporting events. We define Shibari/Bondage as a type of bodily exercise. In sport, bubbles are defined as 50 people. Here we follow the [current guidelines for sport](https://www.sport.vlaanderen/corona-en-sportbeoefening-in-vlaanderen/).

This also means we follow the [Protocol for sport](https://www.sport.vlaanderen/media/13719/protocol-voor-sportkampenvolsen.pdf) for adults and seniors as defined by Sport Flanders.

## Some of the Covid changes
* Move everything outside
* There's no more buffet, you will go to a counter choose what you want, and take this outside.
* The 2 shower rooms will only be used one couple at a time.
* Doors will stay open, alco-gel everywhere, ... 
* The darkroom is canceled. :-(

## Some basic tips/rules/measures:

We'll take our precautions, here's to hoping for good weather so we can use the outside space as much as we can.


* **Always** have your mask _with_ you, we will provide some masks for you if you forgot. Maybe some situation will arise where the org decides it's strictly necessary and you will be asked to put it on. If such a situation should arise, you should be able to put it on.
* Respect people's boundaries, we'll take the 1.5-meter rule as a guideline, if you want to deviate from that, you ask the persons involved. This also implies keeping a distance when queuing for stuff.
* We will take temps of all visitors, but this does, unfortunately, **not** mean everyone is healthy and we can go lie in a big pike exchanging fluids. Asymptomatic people can still transmit. 
* Furthermore we've taken different steps to lower the chances of infection. 
* We do take things seriously, **we're not having an illicit zero-fucks-given party in the woods**, but a legit, small-scale, corona-proof event.
* We've asked you to bring a mug, now we also urge you to bring your knife, fork, and spoon. 
* If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact the orga people. 

## Alternative Approach

It's perfectly OK to camp with us, explore the neighborhood with your partner and return in the evening for the open-air social distanced rope jam. Plenty of stuff to look at and enjoy. 

## In case of symptoms: stay home!
