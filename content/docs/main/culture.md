At Bottoms Up!, we’re not just building a community, we’re building a culture. What’s the difference? A community can exist simply by bringing people together, but a culture is something deeper. It’s about creating a space with shared values, beliefs, and norms that everyone can live by. Our culture is rooted in openness, consent, and the willingness to play together. This is a space where people don’t just come to interact, they come to actively participate in shaping something meaningful.

 We want our culture to be a framework that’s easy to walk into, where everyone feels they belong and can contribute. It’s about shared responsibility, but also shared joy.

A culture can either be open or closed. Closed cultures can be limiting, with rigid boundaries and little room for growth or diversity. We’re all about openness inviting people in, welcoming new ideas, and making space for every voice to be heard. We recognize that creating an open culture takes effort. It means actively working to ensure everyone feels included and respected, and staying flexible enough to adapt as we grow. 

## Creating Space for Openness  
For our culture to thrive, we all need space to be open, to take risks, and to enjoy the ride. This isn’t just about showing up. It’s about being open to new perspectives, experiences, and challenges. By cultivating a space where people feel safe to explore, listen, learn, and have fun, we create an environment that’s dynamic and always evolving.

## Listening with an Open Heart and Mind  
Part of building a culture means listening, truly listening, with an open heart and mind. We encourage people to engage with each other, to have conversations where they can learn from one another, and to approach interactions with kindness. This isn’t about agreeing with everything or avoiding tough conversations, it’s about creating a space where people can speak freely, knowing that they will be heard.

## Balancing Fun with Intentional Growth  
Our culture isn’t all about serious discussions, it’s also about having fun! But that fun is balanced with intentional growth. Whether we’re engaging in playful activities, or diving into deep, meaningful discussions, there’s always an element of learning and growing together. We’re a community that celebrates joy but also understands the importance of reflection and self-awareness.

## A Culture that Thrives on Connection  
Ultimately, the culture we’re building is one that thrives on connection. Every person who walks through the door is part of something larger than themselves, contributing to the collective experience. Our culture isn’t static, it’s alive, breathing, and constantly shaped by the people within it. Together, we create a space where every individual is valued, and where we can all grow, learn, and have fun as a collective.
