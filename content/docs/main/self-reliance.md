### Inclusivity vs Self-Reliance: A Delicate Balance

Our event is a unique experience, where the balance between inclusivity and self-reliance is key. We believe in creating a welcoming and accessible space for all, but it's important to remember that what you send out into the world returns tenfold. Approach this event with an open heart, ready to give as much as you receive.

We recognize that life and relationships come with their own challenges, and when you're in an immersive setting like this, the intensity can amplify. If there’s stress in your life, be prepared for it to become more pronounced. However, that’s part of the transformational journey we offer — a safe space where both joy and challenges can grow and shift in profound ways.

### More Than a 'Normal' Event

This is not your typical event. If you’re expecting a standard shibari workshop where everyone sits and listens to a talk, you’ll be surprised. Our space allows for things to happen that simply don’t occur in more conventional settings. We create an environment where deep connections and unexpected transformations take place — it's an experience that many find deeply transformational.

### A Marathon, Not a Sprint

This event is not a quick one-night affair. Think of it as a marathon, requiring endurance, patience, and presence. It’s designed to be an immersive, ongoing experience that goes beyond our usual short bursts of interaction. You’ll need stamina, both physically and emotionally, to stay engaged throughout.

### Inclusivity as an Everest Expedition

We often compare our events to an expedition up Mount Everest. Inclusivity is a broad and evolving concept, and we strive to ensure that everyone can make it to the base of the mountain. We make efforts to provide accessibility — whether that means ensuring physical access for those with mobility challenges, offering financial support, or adapting our communications to accommodate neurodiverse needs.

We will be there to support you if you stumble along the way to the top. If someone falls down halfway, we’ll do what we can to help. But remember, we’re not sherpas — we won’t carry you to the top. The journey is yours, and you need to come prepared to get out of your tent to make the climb.

### Come Prepared, Leave Transformed

This event offers you the chance to push your boundaries, but it’s important to arrive ready to rely on yourself as much as you rely on the community. The transformation happens through your effort, engagement, and openness. So pack your emotional and physical bags with care — because the climb will be challenging, but the view from the top? Absolutely worth it.
