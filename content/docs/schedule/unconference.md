## Unconference Sessions (Peer-Led)

**When:** Throughout Thursday–Sunday (approx. 10 AM–5 PM)  
**Format:** Lightly facilitated, participant-driven  
**What You'll Find:**

- Rope technique shares and deep dives
- Conversations about dynamics, consent, and power
- Embodiment practices and body work
- Creative projects and artistic expressions
- Philosophical discussions about desire, connection, ritual
- Quiet practices (meditation, journaling, yoga)

### The Four Unconference Rules

1. **Whoever shows up are the right people.**
2. **Whatever happens is the only thing that could have.**
3. **Whenever it starts is the right time.**
4. **It's over when it's over.**

That's it. That's the magic.

### What Might You Offer?

No experts. Just people bringing what's alive.

**What could you bring?**

- A conversation you're hungry to have (e.g., navigating polyamory at gatherings)?
- A skillshare on something you love (e.g., giving a grounding massage, a specific rope technique)?
- A quiet, shared practice (e.g., a guided meditation or an hour of journaling together)?
- A deep dive into a tricky topic (e.g., power dynamics, aftercare, neurodivergence in play)?
- A question or body puzzle you want to explore with others?

We're here for the offbeat, the half-formed, the personal.  
If you care about it, someone else probably does too.
