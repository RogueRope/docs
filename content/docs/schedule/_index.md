# Event Schedule

## 📅 Wednesday–Sunday, 18–22 February 2026

**5 Days of Connection, Ritual & Intimacy**

---

## Overview: The Rhythm of Our Time

This isn't a traditional conference with fixed schedules. Our five days have a **gentle, held structure** that allows for spontaneity, presence, and deep connection.

Each day has:

- A **morning rhythm** (optional practices, early communal time)
- **[Unconference sessions](unconference)** (peer-led, self-organized)
- **Shared meals** and informal connection time
- **Evening offerings** (ceremonies, experiences, or rest)
