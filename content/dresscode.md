### *Dress Code: Ethereal Celestial Bodies*

To make this night truly spectacular, we invite you to express your creativity and embrace the theme of "Celestial Bodies." Each guest is encouraged to draw inspiration from the enchanting and mysterious elements of our solar system. Imagine an array of luminous beings, each embodying the unique essence of a planet, yet all shimmering with a unifying ethereal glow.

Picture yourself as a celestial being:

- *Adorned in airy fabrics that float like stardust*, shimmering with the hues of your chosen planet.
- *Embellished with elements that reflect the beauty and mystery of the cosmos*—be it the floral elegance of Venus, the oceanic grace of Neptune, or the fiery brilliance of Mars.
- *Unified by a touch of celestial light*—whether through glowing accessories, sparkling details, or ethereal, luminescent makeup that captures the radiance of the stars.

### *Celestial Inspirations*

*Lose yourself among the stars* as you step into the role of a celestial body, reflecting the distinctive energies and aesthetics of your chosen planet. Each ensemble should not only embody the spirit of the celestial entity but also shine with a cohesive luminescence that binds us all under the same starry sky.

*Mercury*: Embrace the fleeting beauty of the swift-footed messenger. Imagine a costume that captures the essence of motion, with hints of silver mirroring the planet's metallic core, complemented by delicate winged accessories that whisper of ethereal speed.

*Venus*: Step into the aura of the goddess of love, draped in robes of softest pastel silks, kissed by the golden hues of dawn. Adorn yourself with roses and peonies, crafting an ensemble that breathes romance and beauty into every fiber.

*Earth*: Represent the Blue Planet in all its glory. Think of lush forests and deep oceans, blending greens and blues in a tapestry of life. Embellishments of flora and fauna can accentuate your connection to our nurturing home.

*Mars*: Channel the fiery warrior spirit with bold reds and burnt oranges that speak of Mars' dusty plains. Integrate elements of ancient armor or modern space gear, reflecting the planet's dual role as the god of war and the next frontier for human exploration.

*Jupiter*: Convey the majesty of the solar system’s giant with rich royal blues and striking golds. Consider adding regal elements like a cloak or scepter, symbolizing Jupiter's role as the king of gods and planets.

*Saturn*: Capture the elegance of Saturn's rings with circular motifs and shimmering accents that mimic the icy debris orbiting this beautiful planet. Your attire could feature structured elements, paying homage to Saturn's role as the timekeeper with vintage clocks or hourglass designs.

*Uranus*: Invoke the airy nature of Uranus with shades of ice blue and metallic silver, creating an avant-garde look that defies conventional style, much like the planet's tilted rotation. Accessories could include abstract, geometric shapes to reflect its unique and eccentric vibe.

*Neptune*: Dive deep into the mystique of Neptune, wearing flowing fabrics in oceanic blues and vibrant sea greens. Embellish with sequins or beads that glimmer like the surface of the water under moonlight, enhancing the ethereal, dreamy quality of this planet.

*Pluto*: Though no longer officially a planet, Pluto remains a symbol of the mysteries lying at the edge of our solar system. Dress in dark, rich purples and black, studded with twinkling lights that resemble the distant cosmos. Embrace the theme of transformation and renewal, perhaps with elements that evolve throughout the evening.

### *Unified Celestial Light*

Tie all these elements together with a touch of celestial light—whether it’s through shimmering fabrics, reflective accessories, or subtle integrated lighting. This unifying feature will ensure that, no matter the planet you represent, you shine with the collective luminescence of a galaxy, bringing us together under a canopy of stars.

We can't wait to see the constellation of creativity you bring to life!

## OMG! i suck at dressing up and need help!

For a celestial-themed event with a focus on simplicity and budget-friendliness, guests can still create stunning outfits without spending much time or money. Here are some practical yet imaginative ideas for each planetary inspiration:

*Mercury:*

- *Outfit*: Wear a metallic or gray t-shirt and pair it with a flowing, metallic silver scarf or shawl to evoke the planet’s silvery essence.
- *Accessories*: Add simple silver jewelry or a pair of wing-shaped earrings to reflect Mercury's role as the messenger.

*Venus:*

- *Outfit*: Choose a light, pastel dress or top, and if possible, find something with a floral pattern or texture.
- *Accessories*: A few golden bangles or a floral headband can complete the Venusian theme of beauty and love.

*Earth:*

- *Outfit*: A blue or green top paired with earth-toned pants or a skirt will evoke the planet's colors.
- *Accessories*: Accessorize with wooden beads or a leaf-patterned scarf to reflect Earth's natural beauty.

*Mars:*

- *Outfit*: Opt for a red or orange shirt, ideally in a bold, fiery hue.
- *Accessories*: Add a red bandana or some simple tribal jewelry to emphasize the warrior spirit.

*Jupiter:*

- *Outfit*: Wear a deep blue top with a large, gold belt or sash to symbolize Jupiter's majestic nature.
- *Accessories*: A statement necklace with large, golden elements can echo the grandeur of Jupiter.

*Saturn:*

- *Outfit*: Dress in dark grey or black and loop a large ring-like belt or similar accessory around your waist to mimic Saturn's rings.
- *Accessories*: Subtle, muted jewelry or a headpiece with circular motifs can enhance the sage-like theme.

*Uranus:*

- *Outfit*: Combine turquoise and silver clothing, such as a turquoise shirt with a silver jacket or accessories.
- *Accessories*: Wear futuristic or unusually shaped jewelry to represent innovation.

*Neptune:*

- *Outfit*: A blue or sea-green scarf draped over a simple dress or top can evoke the oceanic theme.

*Pluto:*

- *Outfit*: Dark purple or black attire, with layers to add a sense of mystery.
- *Accessories*: Use accessories with hidden details or luminescent materials to reflect Pluto’s enigmatic and distant nature.

## *Twinkling Stars Initiative*

To further illuminate our celestial gathering, the event organizers will provide twinkling star accessories that can be added to any outfit. These stars might be small clip-on lights, shimmering star-shaped patches, or glowing pins, offering an instant ethereal touch to whatever you choose to wear. Here’s how you can integrate these twinkling stars into your look:

- *Attach to Clothing*: Clip the twinkling stars onto your outfit in clusters to mimic constellations or evenly spread them out to create a starry night effect across your attire.
- *Hair and Headwear*: Fasten these twinkling stars into your hair or on headbands and hats to light up your presence with every turn of your head.
- *Accessories and Props*: Adorn bags, shoes, and other accessories with these stars to extend their glow beyond just your clothing.

Additionally, for those who may not have time to prepare a full costume, wearing these provided twinkling stars alone is also a welcomed and fully embraced option. Simply wearing a dark outfit as a backdrop for multiple twinkling stars can create a stunning and straightforward celestial look, transforming you into a walking piece of the night sky.

Also, feel free to just wear the twinkling stars and a smile. 😊

This approach ensures that everyone, regardless of time or budget, can participate and shine at the event, literally adding to the constellation of creativity that the night promises to be!
