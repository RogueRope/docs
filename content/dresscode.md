### 🌌 *Dress Code: Ethereal Celestial Bodies* 🌌

To make this night truly spectacular, we invite you to express your creativity and embrace the theme of **"Celestial Bodies."** Each guest is encouraged to draw inspiration from the enchanting and mysterious elements of our solar system. Imagine an array of luminous beings, each embodying the unique essence of a planet, yet all shimmering with a unifying ethereal glow. 🌠

**Picture yourself as a celestial being:**

- *Adorned in airy fabrics that float like stardust,* 🌟 shimmering with the hues of your chosen planet.
- *Embellished with elements that reflect the beauty and mystery of the cosmos* 🌌—be it the floral elegance of Venus, the oceanic grace of Neptune, or the fiery brilliance of Mars.
- *Unified by a touch of celestial light*—whether through glowing accessories, sparkling details, or ethereal, luminescent makeup that captures the radiance of the stars.

### 🌠 *Celestial Inspirations* 🌠

*Lose yourself among the stars* as you step into the role of a celestial body, reflecting the distinctive energies and aesthetics of your chosen planet. Each ensemble should not only embody the spirit of the celestial entity but also shine with a cohesive luminescence that binds us all under the same starry sky. 🌟

**Mercury**: Embrace the fleeting beauty of the swift-footed messenger. Imagine a costume that captures the essence of motion, with hints of silver mirroring the planet's metallic core, complemented by delicate winged accessories that whisper of ethereal speed. 🪶

**Venus**: Step into the aura of the goddess of love, draped in robes of softest pastel silks, kissed by the golden hues of dawn. Adorn yourself with roses and peonies, crafting an ensemble that breathes romance and beauty into every fiber. 🌹

**Earth**: Represent the Blue Planet in all its glory. Think of lush forests and deep oceans, blending greens and blues in a tapestry of life. Embellishments of flora and fauna can accentuate your connection to our nurturing home. 🌍

**Mars**: Channel the fiery warrior spirit with bold reds and burnt oranges that speak of Mars' dusty plains. Integrate elements of ancient armor or modern space gear, reflecting the planet's dual role as the god of war and the next frontier for human exploration. 🔥

**Jupiter**: Convey the majesty of the solar system’s giant with rich royal blues and striking golds. Consider adding regal elements like a cloak or scepter, symbolizing Jupiter's role as the king of gods and planets. 👑

**Saturn**: Capture the elegance of Saturn's rings with circular motifs and shimmering accents that mimic the icy debris orbiting this beautiful planet. Your attire could feature structured elements, paying homage to Saturn's role as the timekeeper with vintage clocks or hourglass designs. ⏳

**Uranus**: Invoke the airy nature of Uranus with shades of ice blue and metallic silver, creating an avant-garde look that defies conventional style, much like the planet's tilted rotation. Accessories could include abstract, geometric shapes to reflect its unique and eccentric vibe. ❄️

**Neptune**: Dive deep into the mystique of Neptune, wearing flowing fabrics in oceanic blues and vibrant sea greens. Embellish with sequins or beads that glimmer like the surface of the water under moonlight, enhancing the ethereal, dreamy quality of this planet. 🌊

**Pluto**: Though no longer officially a planet, Pluto remains a symbol of the mysteries lying at the edge of our solar system. Dress in dark, rich purples and black, studded with twinkling lights that resemble the distant cosmos. Embrace the theme of transformation and renewal, perhaps with elements that evolve throughout the evening. 🪐

### ⭐ *Twinkling Stars Initiative* ⭐

To further illuminate our celestial gathering, the event organizers will provide twinkling star accessories that can be added to any outfit. These stars might be small clip-on lights, shimmering star-shaped patches, or glowing pins, offering an instant ethereal touch to whatever you choose to wear. Here’s how you can integrate these twinkling stars into your look:

- **Attach to Clothing**: Clip the twinkling stars onto your outfit in clusters to mimic constellations or evenly spread them out to create a starry night effect across your attire. ✨
- **Hair and Headwear**: Fasten these twinkling stars into your hair or on headbands and hats to light up your presence with every turn of your head. 🌠
- **Accessories and Props**: Adorn bags, shoes, and other accessories with these stars to extend their glow beyond just your clothing. 💫

Additionally, for those who may not have time to prepare a full costume, wearing these provided twinkling stars alone is also a welcomed and fully embraced option. Simply wearing a dark outfit as a backdrop for multiple twinkling stars can create a stunning and straightforward celestial look, transforming you into a walking piece of the night sky. 🌌

Feel free to just wear the twinkling stars and a smile. 😊

### 🌟 *Enthusiastic Consent is Everything* 🌟

You decide how much you (don't) want to dress up. The dress code will not be enforced, and there's no shame in not participating in the dress-up part. 🌟 
Also nothing is set in stone, if you want to go rogue and dress up as a purple hippo in a tutu, be our guest. 

We look forward to seeing your radiant creations! 🌌🌟🌠
