### âœ¨ *Dress Code: Trolls, Faeries & Fabled Creatures* âœ¨

This year, we invite you to **step through the portal** and emerge as your truest, wildest self â€” a creature of the in-between, of moss and moonlight, of tangled roots and sparkling mischief.

Our theme: **Trollen, FeeÃ«n en Fabelwezens**.

Picture it: earthy trolls with mossy skin, mischievous goblins clinking with trinkets, regal elves in vines and silver, glowing faeries dusted with stardust. A forest full of beings that donâ€™t quite belong â€” and never needed to.

Let your costume reflect the creature within â€” or the one you long to become.

### ðŸŒ¿ *Archetypes to Inspire* ðŸŒ¿

**Trolls**: Earth-toned, grounded, and a little gruff. Fur, moss, stones, oversized shapes, funny lumps. Maybe a bark-like mask or a single leafy eyebrow.  

**Faeries**: Light, ethereal, and a little mischievous. Glitter, wings (or not), sheer fabrics, glowing threads. Are you a sun-fae or shadow-fae?

**Goblins**: Chaotic, shiny, cluttercore. Pockets full of treasures â€” bottle caps, buttons, broken keys. Nothing matches. Everything works.

**Forest Witches**: Herbs, cloaks, mysterious pendants. Maybe a bone wand or a grimoire full of secrets. Youâ€™re here for the transformation.

**Elves & Satyrs**: Elegant or wild. Leather straps, horns, leaf crowns, silky tunics, bare feet. Choose mischief, grace, or both.

**Shapeshifters**: Mix everything. Fur and feathers. Layers that change. Let your look evolve over time. Let no one pin you down.

### ðŸŒŒ *Twinkling Tokens of the Fae Realm* ðŸŒŒ

To help you cross into the realm, weâ€™ll provide **twinkling fae tokens** â€” tiny lights, glowing threads, or shimmer patches you can clip onto your look.

Use them:
- **In your hair or horns**
- **Wrapped around wrists, ankles, staffs**
- **Like stars on your skin or cloak**

Short on prep? No worries.  
Dark clothes + a fae token + a glint in your eye = youâ€™re through the portal.

### ðŸŒŸ *Consent is Sacred Magic* ðŸŒŸ

How much (or how little) you dress up is your call.  
The portal opens wide â€” whether youâ€™re covered in moss, dressed in denim, or glittering nipple to toe.

We donâ€™t enforce this theme. Itâ€™s an invitation, not a requirement.

And if you want to come as a purple hippo in a tutu? Thatâ€™s rogue enough for us. ðŸ¦›

We canâ€™t wait to see who â€” or what â€” steps through.
