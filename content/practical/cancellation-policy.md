## Our Approach

We understand life happens. Plans change. Circumstances shift. We're not here to punish you for that.

**That said,** once you register, we commit resources — food, accommodations, supplies are ordered. Our policy balances your needs with our real costs.

---

## The Clear Rule: Up to 3 Weeks Before = Full Refund

**Cancellation window:** Up to 3 weeks before the event (by January 25, 2026)

**Refund:** 100% refund via our ticket vending system

**How to cancel:**
1. Log into your ticket vending account
2. Request cancellation/refund
3. Refund processes within 7 days to your original payment method

**Why this works:** This gives us time to sell your spot to someone on the waitlist, adjust food orders, and reallocate accommodations.

---

## After 3 Weeks: No Refunds

**Cancellation window:** Less than 3 weeks before the event (after January 25, 2026)

**Refund:** No refund

**Why:** We've already purchased food, locked in accommodations, and confirmed our supply chain. Your payment covers costs we've already incurred.

**BUT:** You have options (see [Ticket Transfers & Resale](/practical/ticket-transfers) for alternatives).

---

## Process for Cancellation

### Up to 3 Weeks Before (Refund Eligible)

1. Log into your ticket vending account
2. Click "Request cancellation"
3. Confirm request
4. Refund processes in 7 days

### After 3 Weeks (No Refund, But Options Available)

See [Ticket Transfers & Resale](/practical/ticket-transfers) for how to resell, defer, or request exceptions.

---

## Refund Method

### Where Does Your Money Go?

**Refunds (if approved) go to:**
- Your original payment method (credit card, bank transfer, etc.)
- Processing time: 7 days
- Check your bank; sometimes it takes a few extra days to appear

---

## Partial Attendance

### What If I Can Only Come 2–3 Days?

**You still pay full price** (€285).

**Why:** Food, accommodations, and support are bundled. We can't break them apart.

**But you can:**
- Arrive late (Thursday instead of Wednesday): Tell us; we adjust sleep arrangements
- Leave early (Friday instead of Sunday): Totally fine; meals adjust but price stays same

**Better option:** If you need partial attendance, **reach out before registering.** Maybe we can work something out. But expect to pay full price.

---

## No-Show Policy

### If You Don't Show Up

**Without notice:**
- You forfeit your ticket (no refund)
- We keep your payment
- Your spot can't be reallocated

**With late notice:**
- See refund timeline above

**In emergency (hospitalized, accident, etc.):**
- **Contact us ASAP** when you're able
- We'll assess your situation
- Possible deferral or resale facilitation (depending on circumstances)
