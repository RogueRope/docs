### A Space for Sharing, Not Showing Off

Our unconference is a lightly held container for spontaneous brilliance, shared wisdom, and weird little things you didn’t know you needed to talk about.

There’s no set schedule. No official “teachers.” Just a board, some post-its, and a collective invitation to explore together.

### The Four Unconference Rules

1. Whoever shows up are the right people.  
2. Whatever happens is the only thing that could have.  
3. Whenever it starts is the right time.  
4. It’s over when it’s over.

That’s it. That’s the magic.

## What Might You Offer?

No experts. Just people bringing what’s alive.

What could you bring?
- A conversation you’re hungry to have?
- A practice or technique you’d love to show?
- A rope-related body puzzle?
- A hot take on power dynamics, neurodivergence, play, pain, ritual, or consent?

We’re here for the offbeat, the half-formed, the personal.  
If you care about it, someone else probably does too.

## What Might You Find?

- Group discussions on body reading and negotiation  
- Skillshares on suspension, flow, or aftercare  
- Explorations of fear, shame, intimacy, or archetypes  
- Conversations that leave you cracked open, in the best way

The program comes from **you**. What you offer. What you ask for. What you didn’t know you needed until someone else wrote it down.

## How It Works

Our content crew will help set up the board. You’ll find post-its, markers, and spaces to claim. Sessions will be announced day by day, with time to prepare (or improvise).

Keep an eye out. Listen to what’s bubbling in you.  
And when it’s ready, share it.

We can’t wait to see what unfolds.
