Four easy rules for unconference sessions

* Rule one: Whoever shows up are the right people.
* Rule two: Whatever happens is the only thing that could have.
* Rule three: Whenever it starts is the right time.
* The fourth and final rule is: It’s over when it’s over.

## Think ahead

Now, let's think ahead and prepare for our sessions! We'll be using the classical un-conference format with post-it notes. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

What topics or subjects would you like to see covered or learn more about? We want to make sure we're addressing the needs and interests of our event.
Are there any topics, subjects, workshops, or activities that you'd like to share with others? We believe in peer exchange and want to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their knowledge and expertise.

And here's a tip: there's no need to fall back on the teacher-student paradigm. We encourage peer exchange and want everyone to feel empowered to contribute in their own unique way.

Our content team will announce the sessions in advance, so you'll have plenty of time to prepare and think about what you'd like to discuss or share. We're excited to see what amazing ideas and insights come out of our unconference sessions!
