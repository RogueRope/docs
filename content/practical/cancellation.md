### Sometimes plans change. Sometimes the world does.

We know life is unpredictable — and we’d rather be honest about it from the start. Here’s what happens if you need to cancel, or if we do.

## If We Have to Cancel

If Rogue Rope Camp can’t legally take place — due to Covid regulations, war, or other delightful surprises — we’ll cancel the event. And if that happens, **you’ll get a full refund**.

No hidden fees. No penalties.  
If you paid X euros, we’ll return X euros. Simple.

## If *You* Need to Cancel

Things come up — we get it. If you can’t join us for personal reasons (sickness, schedule shift, life happening), here’s what to do:

### ✦ Reselling or Gifting Your Ticket

You’re welcome to pass your ticket on — but please check with us first.

Every participant needs to be confirmed by the organizers, so don’t sell your ticket to someone we wouldn’t be able to welcome. Send us an email with your replacement’s **FetLife name** and **email**, and we’ll follow up with both of you about how to proceed.

### ✦ Cancelling Directly

- **More than 21 days before camp:**  
  Cancel for free — just go to your booking page and hit the button. That’s it.

- **Less than 21 days before camp:**  
  If we can fill your spot from the waiting list, we’ll refund **90% of your ticket**.  
  If there’s no one waiting, we won’t be able to refund you.

## If the Event Is Cut Short

If camp starts but has to end early — due to weather, wildfires, acts of nature, or anything else outside our control — we unfortunately can’t offer refunds.

We hope it doesn’t happen. But if it does, we’ll handle it with as much care as possible.

Thanks for understanding.  
We built these policies with trust in mind — and trust goes both ways.

If you have questions, reach out. We’ll meet you with clarity and care.
