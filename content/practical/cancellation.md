### Life happens. We get it.

Sometimes the world shifts. Sometimes you do. Plans change — work emergencies, health scares, heartbreaks, or simply the realization that you need something different right now.

We've built these policies with trust in mind — and trust goes both ways. Here's how we handle changes with clarity and care.

## If We Have to Cancel

If Oh Bondage! Up Yours! can't legally take place — due to pandemic restrictions, conflict, natural disasters, or other forces beyond our control — we'll cancel the gathering. And if that happens, **you'll get a full refund**.

No hidden fees. No penalties.  
If you paid X euros, we’ll return X euros. Simple.

## If *You* Need to Cancel

We understand that life rarely goes according to plan. If you can't join us for personal reasons — illness, family needs, work changes, or simply recognizing that this isn't the right moment — here are your options:

### ✦ Reselling or Gifting Your Ticket

You’re welcome to pass your ticket on — but please check with us first.

Every person goes through our gentle vetting process, so we need to connect with your replacement first. Send us an email with their **FetLife name** and **email**, and we'll reach out to both of you to make sure everyone feels comfortable with the transition.

### ✦ Cancelling Directly

- **More than 21 days before the event:**
  Cancel for free — just go to your booking page and hit the button. That’s it.

- **Less than 21 days before the event:**
  If we can fill your spot from the waiting list, we’ll refund **90% of your ticket**.
  If there’s no one waiting, we won’t be able to refund you.

## If the Event Is Cut Short

If the event starts but has to end early — due to facility issues, emergencies, or other circumstances outside our control — we unfortunately can't offer refunds.

This is the hardest policy to write, because we know how disappointing it would be. But if something like this happens, we promise to handle it with as much transparency and care as possible. We'll do everything we can to make the most of whatever time we have together.

Thanks for understanding.  
These policies exist to protect everyone while maintaining the spirit of trust that makes our gathering possible.

If you have questions or find yourself in a situation not covered here, please reach out. We believe in human conversation over rigid rules, and we'll work with you to find a solution that feels fair for everyone.
