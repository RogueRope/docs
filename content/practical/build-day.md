### Build Day is How We Begin

Rogue Rope Camp doesn’t just *appear*.  
It’s built — by hands, by hearts, by you.

Our gathering now begins on **Tuesday**, with **Build Day** folded into the experience itself. No separation. No staff. Just a field, some rope, and a growing circle of people making it real.

This is your invitation to be part of the beginning.

### What to Expect

You don’t need to be strong. Or skilled. Or organized.  
You just need to show up.

We’ll hang lights, set up suspension points, decorate the land, arrange the chill spaces, maybe even rig a secret nook or two. Some will hammer. Some will sweep. Some will make tea and tell stories. All of it counts.

Come early. Arrive Tuesday if you can.  
This is one of the best ways to meet people, soften into the vibe, and become part of the magic *before* it officially begins.

### How It Flows

- **Come When You Can:** Early arrivals are welcome. No sign-up, no pressure. Just show up and join in.  
- **Work + Play:** Tuesday and Wednesday are for build. Play is welcome **after dinner on Wednesday**, and during **Thursday late afternoon**, once the setup is complete.  
- **Coordination Is Casual:** We’ll use a shared WhatsApp group to help organize, or you can just wander in and ask what’s needed. Someone will point you toward tools, tasks, or tunes.

This isn’t just setup.  
It’s a ritual. A soft beginning.  
The first knot in something unforgettable.

Come build it with us.
