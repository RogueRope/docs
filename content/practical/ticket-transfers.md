## Your Options If You Can't Attend

### Option 1: Resell Your Ticket (Recommended)

**You can resell your ticket to someone else.** This way, your money doesn't disappear — it goes to the new buyer.

**How it works:**
1. **Find a buyer** (friend, community group, WhatsApp community, etc.)
2. **Email us** at [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) with:
   - Your name and order number
   - Their name and email
   - Subject: "Ticket transfer request"
3. **We vet the buyer** (quick check — ensuring they understand the event and values)
4. **Once approved,** the transfer is complete in our system
5. **The buyer pays you directly** (we don't handle the money transfer)

**Why we vet:** We want to protect the community and ensure people arrive with aligned expectations.

**Cost to you:** Free. No processing fee. The buyer reimburses you directly.

### Option 2: Defer to Next Year

**You can hold your payment as credit toward 2027.**

- **No refund.**
- **Your €285 credit applies to next year's ticket** (same price, same terms)
- **Email [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be)** with "Deferral request"

---

### Option 3: Wait List Facilitation (If We're Fully Booked)

**If we've sold all 60 tickets and have a waitlist:**

We can add your cancellation to the waitlist pool, and refund the first person who can attend.

**This only works if:**
- We're fully booked (60/60 tickets sold)
- There's an active waitlist

**This doesn't work if:**
- We're not fully booked (your refund just reduces event revenue)
- Your cancellation is within 2 weeks (not enough time to notify waitlist)

---

## Special Circumstances

### Medical or Mental Health Emergency

**Genuine crisis cancellations get compassion:**

1. **Email [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be)** with "Medical emergency cancellation"
2. **Briefly explain** (you don't need to share all details)
3. **We'll discuss:**
   - If we can still facilitate a resale or waitlist refund
   - Deferral to next year (keep your money as credit)
   - Case-by-case exception (rare, but possible)

**We believe in care first.** We won't leave you hanging, but we also can't absorb losses if we're not fully booked.

### Family Emergency

Same process as medical emergency.

We understand priorities shift. We'll work with you on what's possible.

## How to Transfer Your Ticket

### Step-by-Step Transfer Process

**You can transfer your ticket to another person.**

**How:**
1. **You find the buyer** (friend, community member, etc.)
2. **Email [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be)** with:
   - Subject: "Ticket transfer request"
   - Your name and order number
   - New buyer's name and email
   - Brief note (optional): who they are, how you know them
3. **We vet the transfer** (confirm they understand the event)
4. **Transfer approved:** Buyer's info replaces yours in the system
5. **Buyer makes payment to you** (outside our system)

**Vetting process:**
- We check they understand the event is consent-focused, intimate, and community-based
- We ask 1-2 questions to ensure alignment
- Takes 2-3 days
- If approved, we send confirmation to both of you

**This works any time** (even the week before), as long as we have time to update our records.

## Resale Rules

- **You set the price** (we don't control it; that's between you and buyer)
- **You handle payment** (we don't facilitate money transfer)
- **We vet the buyer** (just to protect the community)
- **No processing fee** from us
- **Contact us first** before selling (so we can coordinate vetting)
