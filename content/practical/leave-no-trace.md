## The Basic Idea

Care for shared space is collective. Notice what's yours. Pick it up. Clean what you use. Respect what others have left.

---

## During the Event

**Meal areas:**
- Clean up immediately after eating
- Wipe your table
- Don't leave food out

**Play spaces:**
- Wipe down equipment after use
- Coil rope and return it
- Return furniture to its place

**Sleeping areas:**
- Keep your bunk organized
- Don't leave clothes on floors
- Return shared items to their place

**Bathrooms:**
- Shower quickly
- Wipe surfaces
- Dispose of menstrual products in provided bins

**General:**
- Take trash with you
- Put lights out when you leave rooms
- If you see something off, fix it or report it

## Final Day Checkout

- Strip your bed
- Collect all your belongings
- Clean your bunk area
- Return room key
- Leave nothing behind except gratitude

---

## After You Leave

**Don't post event photos to public social media.** Our space is intimate and protected. Share your experience in words, not images.

**Respect people's privacy online.** Don't out anyone. Protect the sacredness of what happened.

## Why It Matters

When we leave space better than we found it, we:
- Show respect for the venue
- Demonstrate consent (even to the building)
- Practice caring—which is what this gathering is about
- Make the next gathering possible

**It becomes a practice you carry into your life.**
