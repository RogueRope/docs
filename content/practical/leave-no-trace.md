### The Land Holds Us. Let’s Hold It, Too.

Rogue Rope Camp takes place in a wild, beautiful space — and we want to keep it that way. That means leaving no trace behind. No trash. No damage. No mess for someone else to clean up.

We treat the land like we treat each other: with care, with respect, and with attention.

### No Trash Cans. No Problem.

There are no garbage bins on site — by design. That means **whatever you bring in, you take back out**.

Some tips to make that easy:
- Pack light and leave excess packaging at home.
- Bring a small bag for your personal waste.
- Use reusable containers and tools whenever you can.
- Be mindful of what you consume — it adds up.

### Sort It Before You Leave

- **Compostable stuff** (food scraps, paper napkins, etc.): We’ll have designated bins for these on site.  
- **Recyclables** (glass, metal, clean plastic): Pack them out. Sort them at home.  
- **Trash that can’t be recycled** (wrappers, mixed materials, etc.): Take it with you. Please don’t leave it behind.

### Coming by Train or Bus?

We don’t expect you to carry garbage bags on public transport. If you’re not driving, let us know — we’ll sort out a way to help with your trash.

### Smokers, Read This

If you smoke, bring a **portable ashtray**. Pocket tins, old film canisters, or custom buttpouches all work. Keep your butts off the ground — for fire safety, and because no one wants to kneel in someone else’s cigarette.

We want to be invited back.  
We want the land to feel loved.  
We want to show what a kinky camp can do when it cares.

Leave no trace. Leave beauty instead.
