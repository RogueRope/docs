#### General Guidelines
- Ensure you take **all your trash** and belongings back home with you.
- Keep the space clean and pristine for everyone to enjoy.

#### No Trash Cans On-Site
Due to the absence of trash cans on-site, it is crucial to plan and manage your waste:
- Bring reusable containers and bags to minimize waste.
- Remove excess packaging from items before bringing them to the event.
- Carry a small trash bag with you to collect waste throughout the day.
- Be mindful of your consumption and only bring what you need.

#### Specific Waste Categories
- **Compostable Waste:**
  - Compostable items like organic waste (food scraps, paper napkins, etc.) can be dealt with on-site. Ensure these are disposed of in designated composting bins.
- **Recyclables:**
  - Take home recyclable materials such as plastic, glass, and metal. Separate these from other waste types and bring them back for proper recycling.
- **Non-Recyclable Waste:**
  - All other waste, especially non-recyclables, must be taken home. This includes items like plastic wrappers, Styrofoam, and mixed materials that cannot be easily recycled.

#### Special Arrangements for Public Transport Users
- If you are coming by public transport, special arrangements can be made to help you manage your waste. We don't expect you to take a bag of empty cans on a train. 

#### For Smokers
- If you smoke, please use a portable ashtray to collect your cigarette butts. This helps prevent ground pollution and fire risks. Be sure to dispose of the contents responsibly when you return home.
