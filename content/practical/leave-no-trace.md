### The Space Holds Us. Let's Hold It, Too.

Oh Bondage! Up Yours! takes place in a shared, welcoming space — and we want to keep it that way. That means leaving our shared space as we found it. No damage. No burden for someone else to clean up.

We treat the space like we treat each other: with care, with respect, and with attention.

### Respect the Shared Spaces

While we have waste facilities available, we ask everyone to be mindful of the shared indoor environment. That means **being responsible for your own waste and respecting common areas**.

Some tips to make that easy:
- Pack light and leave excess packaging at home.
- Bring a small bag for your personal waste.
- Use reusable containers and tools whenever you can.
- Be mindful of what you consume — it adds up.

### Sort Your Waste

- **Compostable stuff** (food scraps, paper napkins, etc.): We'll have designated bins for these on site.
- **Recyclables** (glass, metal, clean plastic): Use the recycling facilities provided.
- **Trash that can't be recycled** (wrappers, mixed materials, etc.): Use the provided trash facilities. Please don't leave waste in common areas.

### Smoking Policy

We have designated outdoor smoking areas. If you smoke, please use these areas and keep the indoor spaces smoke-free. Bring a portable ashtray for any brief outdoor moments.

We want to be invited back.
We want the space to feel loved.
We want to show what a kinky gathering can do when it cares.

Leave no mess. Leave beauty instead.
