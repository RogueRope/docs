## Environmental Impact

We care about how we make things.

**Our approach:**
- **Organic or sustainable cotton** (reduced pesticide use)
- **Ethical printing** (low-chemical, water-based inks)
- **Small batch production** (only make what we sell)
- **Designed to last** (quality stitching, durable materials)
- **Encouragement to wear it** (the best garment is one you wear)

**We ask you to:**
- Wash cold, air dry (lasts longer)
- Repair rather than replace
- Donate or swap when you're done (keep it in circulation)
- Recycle when it's truly at end-of-life

**Wear it with pride.**
