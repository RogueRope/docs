**Campsite Setup:**
- **Space Efficiency:** Bring only the essentials and set up your tents close together. Think of it as defragmenting like it's Windows 95—no gaps!
- **Smaller is better:** We prefer it if you bring a smaller tent rather than an extremely elaborate camping setup. 
- **Communal Kinky Village:** While we can't spread out individually, we’ll collectively build our quirky retreat in the forest and communal areas. Get ready for some collective creativity!

**Electricity and Gadgets:**
- **Power Supply:** We’ll distribute electricity throughout the campsite. Bring the longest extension cord you have, along with a power strip, to keep your devices charged.
- **Device Restrictions:** Please avoid connecting high-power devices such as fridges, hair dryers, or air conditioners to avoid overloading our system.

**Weather and Environment:**
- **Prevent Damage:** If it rains, please **do not** dig trenches around your tent. Our agreement requires us to leave the campsite as pristine as we found it.
- **Smoking Etiquette:** Limit smoking to areas away from the tents, ideally near the firepit. Use designated ash trays to dispose of cigarette butts. And yes, if your smoke has a peculiar aroma, it’s all cool—just pass it leftward for good karma!

**Decor and Amenities:**
- **Light It Up:** Bring your Christmas lights or funky LED strips to brighten the night.
- **Facilities:** Enjoy the indoor toilets and showers—no portable toilets here!
- **Cooler Tips:** Opt for a box cooler or an insulated supermarket bag to keep things cool without turning your setup into a pool.

**Cooking and Dining:**
- **Leave the Gear at Home:** No need for makeshift stoves or cooking equipment; we’ve got the warm meals covered.

**Sleeping Arrangements:**
- **Outdoor Accommodations:** There’s limited indoor space reserved for activities, so your best bet is to camp outdoors. Whether it’s a tent, van, or camper, you’ll want to be prepared.
- **Camper:** Send a private message if you want to bring a camper so we can plan / accomodate for it, not sure if we can accomodate all, but we'll try!

**Toilets and Showers**
Please note that our campsite is equipped with three toilets and a single shower cabin that contains two shower heads. We recognize that the shared nature of the shower cabin may not offer the level of privacy some campers might prefer. We encourage campers to coordinate with each other to ensure comfort, safety and privacy when using these facilities. We strive to keep these amenities clean and well-maintained, and we appreciate your understanding and cooperation.
