### A Field. A Fire. A Home for a While.

The campsite is simple — just how we like it.  
A field with trees, a firepit, and space to build something weird and wonderful together.

No glamping. No assigned spots.  
Just shared ground and a little chaos magic.

---

### Setting Up

- **Pack light, pitch tight.** Bring only what you need and set up close to your neighbors. Think Tetris, not Versailles.  
- **Smaller is sweeter.** We’d love it if you left the four-room party palace at home and brought something humble instead.  
- **We’re building a kinky village.** You’ll have space to decorate, co-create, and add your flavor to our communal corners. Come ready to play with the vibe.

---

### Electricity & Devices

- **There is power.** We’ll run electricity through the camp — just bring your **longest extension cord** and a power strip.  
- **But not too much.** No fridges, hair dryers, AC units, or anything with a heavy draw. You’ll blow the whole grid. Seriously.

---

### Weather & Ground Rules

- **No trench warfare.** If it rains, don’t dig around your tent — we’re guests on this land, and we leave it as we found it.  
- **Smoke if you got it — respectfully.** Keep cigarettes (or whatever else you're smoking) away from tents. Use the firepit zone, and pass it left for good karma.

---

### Comfort & Decor

- **Fairy lights encouraged.** Bring LEDs, soft glows, solar sparkles — whatever lights you up at night.  
- **Toilets and showers? Yes.** Three indoor toilets and a shared shower cabin with two heads. It’s not spa-level private, so coordinate with care and kindness.  

---

### Cooking & Cooling

- **Don’t bring a stove.** We’ve got warm meals covered. You get to rest and eat.  
- **Want cold drinks?** Bring a cooler box or an insulated grocery bag. Low-tech, high reward.

---

### Where You’ll Sleep

- **Tents, vans, campers — all good.** Just let us know if you’re bringing a camper, so we can do our best to make space. No guarantees, but we’ll try.  
- **Indoor space is limited.** It’s reserved for activities, so plan to sleep outdoors unless we’ve talked.

### Can’t Camp? Let’s Talk.

We know camping isn’t possible for everyone — and we don’t want that to be a barrier if your heart is set on being here.

If you’d rather **sleep off-site** (in a nearby B&B, hotel, or rental), that’s okay. We’ve had folks do that before. What matters most is that you're still fully part of the experience — not just dropping in.

We’ll ask that you **commit to the key shared moments** — like the opening circle, the knotting ceremony, and other grounding points that help shape the collective container. We’ll talk it through together and make clear agreements that work for everyone.

**If you're planning to stay off-site, please let us know when you book your ticket.**

This camp is temporary.  
But the way it *feels* — if we do it right — might just stay with you forever.
