## Sleeping Close

Nights shape us as much as days.
The way we rest, the way we hear each other breathing, the way we wake up into shared light — it all weaves into the story of this gathering.

This isn't about luxury.
It's about proximity. About choosing to be held by a space, and by each other.

## What You'll Find

* **Bunk beds indoors** — no tents, no weather worries. Each person gets their own bed and mattress. Bring the bedding that makes you feel safe and soft.
* **Different room flows** — mixed rooms for those who like variety, FLINTA-only rooms (for people here who are Female, Lesbian, Intersex, Non-binary, Trans, and Agender) for those who want that layer of safety, and a "snoring sanctuary" for the heavy sleepers and their companions.
* **Real facilities** — hot showers, indoor toilets, places to brush your teeth, splash water on your face, and return renewed.

It's simple. But it's real.

## The Atmosphere

Don't expect hotel silence. Expect life.
Whispers between bunks at midnight. Someone brewing tea in the morning for whoever's awake. A soft shuffle of blankets. Occasional laughter, occasional tears.

This is what communal rest feels like. A little messy. Deeply human. Intimate in the most ordinary ways.

Some nights you'll fall asleep faster than you thought. Some nights you'll lie awake, listening to breath, and feel strangely grateful you're not alone.

## If You Need Different

Communal sleeping isn't for everyone. That's okay.
If privacy is something you need, or if shared rest feels unsafe for you right now, talk to us.

* **Nearby stays** — B&Bs and hotels are available close to the venue.
* **Hybrid approach** — Some choose to sleep off-site but commit to the key shared rituals that shape the gathering. That works, too.

If this is you, tell us when you register. We'll help make sure you can still be woven into the fabric of the group.

## Why It Matters

Rope isn't the only thread here. So is breakfast together. So is brushing teeth side by side. So is sharing a room where nothing needs to be hidden.

We believe intimacy isn't just in the knots. It's also in the silence of shared rest.

Bring your blanket. Bring your breath.
The night will hold us all.
