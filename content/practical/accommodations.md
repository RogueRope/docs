### Warm Beds. Shared Dreams. A Home Away from Home.

This winter, we're coming indoors.  
No tents in frozen fields. No frost on sleeping bags.  
Just warm dormitory spaces with bunk beds, community areas, and the gentle hum of people finding each other in close quarters.

Think hostel life with kinky hearts — budget-friendly comfort where connection happens as naturally as breathing.

### What to Expect

- **Bunk Beds for Everyone.** Your own sleeping space with a mattress, in shared rooms designed for rest and community.  
- **Diverse Room Options.** Choose what feels safest: mixed rooms, FLINTA-only spaces, or our designated "snoring-friendly" room for heavy sleepers and their allies.  
- **Indoor Everything.** Real toilets, hot showers, and no midnight walks to the porta-potty. Winter just got easier.

---

### Room Types

- **Mixed Rooms** — Open to all genders, perfect for those who love the full social experience.  
- **FLINTA Rooms** — Safe spaces for women, lesbians, inter, non-binary, trans, and agender folks.  
- **Snoring Sanctuary** — For those who snore proudly (or sleep deeply despite it). Your people are here.

---

### What's Included

- **Your Bunk** — A bed with a mattress. Bring your bedding, sleeping bag, or whatever makes you cozy.  
- **Shared Spaces** — Common areas for late-night conversations, morning coffee, and everything in between.  
- **Power Access** — Charge your devices indoors, but please leave energy-heavy appliances at home.  
- **Indoor Facilities** — Hot showers, real toilets, and the luxury of not braving the cold for basic needs.

### The Hostel Vibe

This isn't a hotel. It's not private or pristine.  
It's communal, a little chaotic, and absolutely alive with the energy of people choosing to share space, stories, and maybe a few snores.

Some nights you'll fall asleep to whispered conversations in the next bunk.  
Some mornings you'll wake to someone making tea for the whole room.  
It's intimate. It's real. It's exactly what winter gatherings should feel like.

### Can't Do Shared Spaces? Let's Talk.

We know communal sleeping isn't for everyone — and that's okay.  
If you need more privacy or have specific accommodation needs, reach out to us. We'll work together to find solutions that let you be fully part of the experience.

**Off-site stays are possible** — nearby B&Bs, hotels, or rentals — as long as you commit to the key shared moments that shape our collective container.

**If you're planning to stay off-site, let us know when you book.**

This isn't just about where you sleep.  
It's about choosing to be close. To share breath, space, and the tender vulnerability of rest.  
To wake up knowing you're exactly where you belong.
