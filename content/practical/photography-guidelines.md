## Our Philosophy

**Your image is yours.** Your consent to be photographed is sacred.

We take photos to:
- Capture memories for attendees
- Document the experience
- Create an archive of our community

We do NOT:
- Post your image online without permission
- Share photos on social media
- Use your image for promotion or commercial purposes
- Allow third-party photography
- Force anyone into frames

**Your body, your image, your choice.**

## What Happens With Photos

### Who Takes Photos?

**Official photographers:** 1-2 designated community members with clear cameras and consent badges

**Personal photos:** Attendees can take photos for personal use

**No phones during intimate moments:** We ask for phone-free spaces during certain activities (mentioned at opening circle)

---

### Photo Times

**We announce photo times clearly:**
- Before the Opening Circle
- During afternoon "jam spaces" (optional)
- At the play party
- Other moments as appropriate

**If we're photographing, we'll say so.**

You can:
- Step out of frame
- Say "no photos" to photographers
- Decline specific photos

**It's that simple.**

## Privacy & Consent Framework

### Opting Out of Photography

**You can opt out at any time:**

1. **Wear a "no photos" indicator** (badge or armband — provided at check-in)
2. **Tell photographers directly:** "I prefer not to be photographed"
3. **Opt out during consent moment:** We'll ask who opts out; you'll be noted
4. **Tell Consent Crew:** They can spread the word

**Photographers respect these choices immediately.**

---

### Photo Removal

**Changed your mind after the event?**

Email [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) with:
- Your name
- Which photos you want removed
- Brief reason (optional)

We'll delete them within 48 hours. No questions asked. No judgment.

---

### If You're in a Photo You Didn't Consent To

**This is a violation. We take it seriously.**

1. **Report it immediately** to [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) or a Consent Crew member
2. **The photo is removed immediately**
3. **We address it with the photographer**
4. **This is a boundary violation** — we take accountability seriously

---

## Personal Photography

### Can I Bring a Camera?

**Yes, with guidelines:**

**During play spaces:**
- You can bring a camera for personal use
- But check consent before photographing
- Some scenes are intimate — respect that
- If you're playing, put the camera down

**During opening/closing circles:**
- Cameras are welcome for personal memory-keeping
- But phone-free during circle itself (put it away)

**Private moments:**
- Some people don't want to be photographed
- Honor that

---

### Videography

**Personal video is not allowed** during intimate/play moments.

Videos create different risks:
- Harder to control sharing
- Easier to distribute without consent
- Creates documentation that feels different from photos

**If you want to capture something, take a photo instead.**

## Questions?

**Want to discuss before the event?** Let us know during registration.

**Changed your mind about being photographed?** Tell us anytime — before, during, or after the event.
