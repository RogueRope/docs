## Frequently Asked Questions

### Logistics & Practical

**What's included in my ticket?**
Your ticket (€169) includes access to all activities, shared meals throughout the event, indoor bunk bed accommodation, and use of all facilities (showers, common areas, etc.).

**What are the sleeping arrangements like?**
We provide indoor bunk beds in shared dormitory-style rooms. You'll have your own bed and mattress - just bring your own bedding. Room options include mixed rooms, FLINTA-only rooms, and a "snoring sanctuary" for heavy sleepers.

**Can I attend if I have dietary restrictions?**
Yes! We accommodate vegetarian, vegan, and most dietary restrictions. Please let us know your needs when you register so we can plan accordingly.

**When do tickets go on sale and how much do they cost?**
Tickets go on sale **December 1st at 20:00**. Can't afford the full price? We offer sliding scale options, payment plans, and work exchange. Email us at [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) - no shame, just honest conversation.

### Experience & Community

**Do I need rope experience to attend?**
Not at all. We welcome people at all levels - from complete beginners to experienced practitioners. Curiosity and openness matter more than skill level.

**Is this a session/lab-based learning event?**
This is primarily a community gathering focused on connection and authentic experience. You'll learn through doing and sharing, but it's not structured as traditional sessions.

**What if I don't want to participate in rope?**
That's completely fine. Rope is welcome, not required. Many people come for the community, atmosphere, and other forms of connection and play.

**Can I come alone?**
Absolutely. Many people attend solo. We create structures and spaces that make it easy to connect with others naturally and without pressure.

**What’s the photo policy?**  
**Consent-only.** Take photos only of yourself or people who agreed **before** the shot. **No bystanders. No disturbance. Delete on request.**  
See: [Photography Guidelines](/practical/photography-guidelines) and [Photo Privacy & Sharing](/practical/photo-privacy-sharing).

**What if I feel overwhelmed during the event?**
We have quiet spaces, peer support (FWBs — anyone wearing a bracelet who's available), our trained Consent Crew for boundaries and safety issues, and a culture that honors your right to step back, rest, or leave if needed. Self-care is encouraged, not discouraged.

## Cancellation Policy

### Life happens. We get it.

Sometimes the world shifts. Sometimes you do. Plans change — work emergencies, health scares, heartbreaks, or simply the realization that you need something different right now.

We've built these policies with trust in mind — and trust goes both ways.

### If We Have to Cancel

If Bottoms Up! can't legally take place — due to public-health orders, safety directives, or other force-majeure conditions — we'll cancel the gathering. And if that happens, **you'll get a full refund**.

No hidden fees. No penalties.  
If you paid X euros, we'll return X euros. Simple.

### If You Need to Cancel

We understand that life rarely goes according to plan. If you can't join us for personal reasons — illness, family needs, work changes, or simply recognizing that this isn't the right moment — here are your options:

**Reselling or Gifting Your Ticket**
You're welcome to pass your ticket on — but please check with us first. Here's how it works:

1. **Email us** with your replacement's FetLife name and email
2. **We contact them** to confirm their interest and vibe-check compatibility
3. **We flip the ticket** once they've been approved — simple as that

Every person goes through our gentle vetting process to make sure everyone feels comfortable with the transition.

**Refund Policy**
- **Up to 3 weeks before** (by January 25, 2026): **100% refund**
- **Less than 3 weeks before**: **No refund**, but you can transfer/resell your ticket

We know life is unpredictable. If you're facing genuine hardship or a real emergency, reach out to us directly at [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be). We care about you more than the money.

**For full details on the cancellation process, refund method, and alternatives to cancellation, see: [Cancellation & Refund Policy](/practical/cancellation-policy)**

## Photography Guidelines

### This is a private space. That includes your camera roll.

Bottoms Up! is a place where people come to be real — raw, soft, naked, messy, tender, fierce. That kind of openness requires deep trust.

**Core Rule: No photos or videos without explicit consent. Ever.**
That means every person in frame — foreground or background.
Blur is not consent. Assumption is not consent.
**Ask first. Every time.**

For full photography and video guidelines, see: [Photography Guidelines](/practical/photography-guidelines)

### Social Media Guidelines

If you're posting to FetLife, Instagram, or anywhere else:  
- Only share what someone has *clearly agreed to*
- That includes tagging, stories, and vibes  
- Ask before you tag, ask before you post
- Ask even if it feels obvious

We keep most things offline. If you share at all, do it only with explicit consent from everyone visible.

### Venue Privacy

Please:
- Avoid venue names and identifying wide shots when posting
- Crop/blur signage or distinctive features
- Never add time or precise location details

## Venue Respect

### The Space Holds Us. Let's Hold It, Too.

Bottoms Up! takes place in a shared, welcoming space — and we want to keep it that way. That means leaving our shared space as we found it. No damage. No burden for someone else to clean up.

We treat the space like we treat each other: with care, with respect, and with attention.

### Respect the Shared Spaces

While we have waste facilities available, we ask everyone to be mindful of the shared indoor environment. That means **being responsible for your own waste and respecting common areas**.

Some tips to make that easy:
- Pack light and leave excess packaging at home
- Bring a small bag for your personal waste
- Use reusable containers and tools whenever you can
- Be mindful of what you consume — it adds up

### Waste Sorting

- **Compostable stuff** (food scraps, paper napkins, etc.): Designated bins on site
- **Recyclables** (clean containers, paper, etc.): Separate collection  
- **General waste**: Keep to minimum, use provided bins
- **Hazardous items** (batteries, etc.): Take with you when you leave

### Clean As You Go

- Clean up after meals and activities
- Put equipment back where you found it
- Report any damage or spills immediately
- Leave shared bathrooms tidy for the next person

We want to show what a kinky gathering can do when it cares.

Leave no mess. Leave beauty instead.

## Health & Safety Guidelines

### Before You Arrive

- Please don't attend if you're feeling unwell
- Bring any medications you need
- Let us know about any health conditions that might affect your experience
- Consider your mental/emotional capacity for an intensive community experience

### During the Event

- Stay hydrated and eat regularly
- Get adequate rest between activities
- Check in with yourself regularly about your comfort and capacity
- Ask for help when you need it — that's what community is for

### Consent & Boundaries

- Consent is ongoing and can be withdrawn at any time
- "No" is a complete sentence that needs no explanation
- If someone says no to you, accept it gracefully
- Watch for non-verbal signs of discomfort
- When in doubt, check in verbally
- **Be open with play partners about your state of mind and any substances that may alter it** — this includes alcohol, cannabis, prescription medications, or any other legal or illegal substances that might affect your judgment, perception, or ability to give informed consent

Remember: This isn't just about physical safety, but emotional and energetic well-being too.
