## Build Day - Tuesday

### Arrival flows into build.

Oh Bondage! Up Yours! doesn't just *appear*.  
It's built — by hands, by hearts, by you.

Our gathering now begins on **Tuesday**, with **Build Day** folded into the experience itself. No separation. No staff. Just a space, some rope, and a growing circle of people making it real.

This is your invitation to be part of the beginning.

### What to Expect

You don't need to be strong. Or skilled. Or organized.  
You just need to show up.

We'll hang lights, set up suspension points, decorate the space, arrange the chill spaces, maybe even rig a secret nook or two. Some will hammer. Some will sweep. Some will make tea and tell stories. All of it counts.

Come early. Arrive Tuesday if you can.  
This is one of the best ways to meet people, soften into the vibe, and become part of the magic *before* it officially begins.

## Accommodations

### Sleeping Close

Nights shape us as much as days.
The way we rest, the way we hear each other breathing, the way we wake up into shared light — it all weaves into the story of this gathering.

This isn't about luxury.
It's about proximity. About choosing to be held by a space, and by each other.

### What You'll Find

**🏠 Indoor Accommodations:**
* **Bunk beds indoors** — no tents, no weather worries. Each person gets their own bed and mattress. Bring the bedding that makes you feel safe and soft.
* **Real facilities** — hot showers, indoor toilets, places to brush your teeth, splash water on your face, and return renewed.

**🛏️ Room Options:**
* **Mixed rooms** — for those who like variety
* **FLINTA-only rooms** — for people who are Female, Lesbian, Intersex, Non-binary, Trans, and Agender
* **"Snoring sanctuary"** — for heavy sleepers and their companions

It's simple. But it's real.

### The Atmosphere

Don't expect hotel silence. Expect life.
Whispers between bunks at midnight. Someone brewing tea in the morning for whoever's awake. A soft shuffle of blankets. Occasional laughter, occasional tears.

This is what communal rest feels like. A little messy. Deeply human. Intimate in the most ordinary ways.

Some nights you'll fall asleep faster than you thought. Some nights you'll lie awake, listening to breath, and feel strangely grateful you're not alone.
