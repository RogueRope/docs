### This is a private space. That includes your camera roll.

Oh Bondage! Up Yours! is a place where people come to be real — raw, soft, naked, messy, tender, fierce. That kind of openness requires deep trust.

So let’s be clear:

---

**No photos or videos without explicit consent. Ever.**  
That means every person in frame — foreground or background.  
Blur is not consent. Assumption is not consent.  
**Ask first. Every time.**

If you’re posting to FetLife, Instagram, or anywhere else:  
Only share what someone has *clearly agreed to*.  
That includes tagging. That includes stories. That includes vibes.  
Ask before you tag. Ask before you post. Ask even if it feels obvious.

## Maybe: A System for Consent-Based Photography

We’re exploring an **opt-in system** — maybe color-coded bracelets or visible markers — to support light, consensual documentation.

If we go forward with it, it will be:

- Strictly opt-in  
- Clearly explained  
- Easy to change your mind

It’s not confirmed yet. But if it is, we’ll tell you during the event — and make sure everyone knows the boundaries.

## Don’t Post Pictures of the Site

We love this space.
We want to keep using it. Protecting it includes protecting its anonymity.

Please:

- Don’t post identifiable photos of the venue
- Don’t share wide shots of the venue
- Do enjoy pictures for personal use — just don’t publish them online

Think of it this way:  
**The venue didn’t consent to be exposed.** Let’s return the privacy it offers us.

## A Note on Metadata

Social media often uploads more than just your photo — GPS data, file names, hidden links.  
If you’re sharing anything, double-check what’s included. Better yet?  
**Don’t share at all unless you’re absolutely sure.**

---

## If There’s a Problem

If someone takes your photo without consent — or posts something that violates these boundaries — tell us.  
We’ll handle it. Swiftly. Quietly. Clearly.  
Consent is not negotiable here.
