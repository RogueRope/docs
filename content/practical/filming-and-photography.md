### This is a private space. That includes your camera roll.

Rogue Rope Camp is a place where people come to be real — raw, soft, naked, messy, tender, fierce. That kind of openness requires deep trust.

So let’s be clear:

---

**No photos or videos without explicit consent. Ever.**  
That means everyone in frame. Foreground or background. Blur is not consent. Assumption is not consent.  
Ask first. Every time.

If you’re posting to FetLife, Instagram, or anywhere else:  
**Only share what people have clearly agreed to.**  
That includes tagging — ask before you tag. Ask before you share. Ask even if you think it’s obvious.

## Maybe: A System for Consent-Based Photography

We’re considering setting up an **opt-in system** — maybe color-coded bracelets or visible markers — to allow for some light, consensual documentation. Something that makes it easier for photographers and subjects to find each other, and for boundaries to be known in advance.

But nothing is finalized yet.

If we do implement this, it will be **strictly opt-in**, with clear limits, and you’ll always be able to change your mind.

Stay tuned — we’ll let you know during camp if this system is available.

## Don’t Post Pictures of the Site

We love this land — and we want to keep using it. So please:

- Don’t post identifiable photos of the location.
- Don’t share wide shots of the grounds or buildings.
- Do enjoy pictures for personal use — just don’t publish them online.

Think of it this way:  
**The site didn’t consent to be exposed.** Let’s return the privacy it offers us.

## A Note on Metadata & Online Sharing

Social media platforms often upload more than you realize — GPS data, file history, personal links. If you're sharing anywhere, double-check what’s included. Better yet? Don’t share at all unless you're absolutely sure.

## If There’s a Problem

If someone takes your photo without consent — or posts something that violates these boundaries — tell us. We’ll handle it. Consent is not negotiable here.

Rogue Rope Camp is built on trust.  
That means what happens here, stays here — unless everyone involved says otherwise.
