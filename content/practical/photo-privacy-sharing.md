## What Happens to Photos

### After the Event (Within 1 Week)

**Photos are uploaded to a private attendee-only portal**
- You can view and download photos you're in
- You can share photos to the community if you want

**Long-term:**
- Organizers keep an archive for future gatherings
- Community members can request photo removal if they change their mind
- Photos are never posted publicly without explicit consent

## Sharing Photos

### Within Our Community

**You can share photos:**
- In the private participant WhatsApp group
- With other participants you met
- For personal memory-keeping

**You should NOT:**
- Post to public social media without permission from others in the photo
- Share photos without consent from all people visible
- Use photos for commercial purposes
- Screenshot and repost elsewhere

**Why?** Privacy. Respect. Safety. Some participants need anonymity in their regular lives.

### With the Outside World
We prefer to keep things low-profile. **If you do share publicly (FetLife, Instagram, blogs):**
- Share **only** shots where **every person** consented **before** the photo **and** to **public posting**.  
- **No bystanders.** No faces or identifiable marks without explicit consent.  
- **Anonymize the venue.** Avoid names, wide establishing shots, signage, maps, or time/location details.  
- Be ready to **delete** if anyone changes their mind later.

**Not sure? Don’t post. Ask us first.**

### Public Announcements

**Organizers will:**
- Share event details in advance (marketing, info)
- Use photos only with explicit consent from people in them
- Never tag names or identify people in public posts
- Represent the gathering thoughtfully, not sensationally

## Nude & Intimate Imagery

### How We Handle Sensitive Photos

**If photos contain nudity or intimate moments:**

- Photos are kept private to attendee portal only
- Enhanced security on these images
- Never posted publicly by organizers

**You own your image.** Organizers are just the keepers.
