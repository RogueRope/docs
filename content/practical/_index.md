## Before You Say Yes

Take a breath.  
Rogue Rope Camp isn’t just a festival — it’s a full-body, full-heart experience. It can stretch you. It might stir things up. That’s part of the beauty. And also part of the reason to pause and ask:

Are you ready to meet this intensity with care?  
Can you engage without burning out?  
Is now the right moment for this kind of dive?

We’d love to have you — *if* it’s a true yes.  
If it’s not, that’s okay too. Honoring your limits is one of the most powerful forms of self-respect we know.

## Build Day = Shared Beginnings

Camp officially opens on **Tuesday** with **Build Day**.  
This isn’t about hard labor or special skills — it’s about power in numbers.  
One of the easiest ways to meet people and start feeling the flow *before* things begin.

Come hang lights. Decorate a tent. Make coffee. Tie something weird to a tree. Add your energy. Every bit helps.

And trust us: the people who show up early?  
They tend to find the magic first.
