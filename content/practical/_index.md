## Getting Real About the Details

This is where theory meets practice. Where intention meets logistics. Where we turn "sounds amazing" into "here's exactly what you need to know."

### Quick Navigation

- [**Logistics**](/practical/logistics): food, accommodations, and what to bring
- [**Participation**](/practical/participation): tickets, merch, build day, and unconference
- [**Performances**](/practical/performances): when rope meets the stage

## Before You Say Yes

Take a breath.  
Oh Bondage! Up Yours! isn't just a gathering — it's a full-body, full-heart experience. It can stretch you. It might stir things up. That’s part of the beauty. And also part of the reason to pause and ask:

Are you ready to meet this intensity with care?  
Can you engage without burning out?  
Is now the right moment for this kind of dive?

We’d love to have you — *if* it’s a true yes.  
If it’s not, that’s okay too. Honoring your limits is one of the most powerful forms of self-respect we know.

## Build Day = Shared Beginnings

The gathering opens on **Wednesday afternoon** with **Build Day**.
This isn’t about hard labor or special skills — it’s about power in numbers.
One of the easiest ways to meet people and start feeling the flow *before* things begin.

Come hang lights. Arrange the lounge areas. Make coffee. Set up creative installations. Add your energy. Every bit helps.

And trust us: the people who show up early?  
They tend to find the magic first.
