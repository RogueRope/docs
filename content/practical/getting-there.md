## Early Arrival (Build Day)

### Why Arrive Early?

**Build Day is Wednesday starting around 14:00.** This is the best way to arrive because:
- Meet people before the intensity begins
- Help shape the space (hang lights, arrange comfort areas)
- Soften into the energy gradually
- Skip some of the arrival rush
- Get your pick of rooms/bunks

### Wednesday Arrival Flow

**14:00–18:00** — Arrive, check in, unload, settle into your room
**18:00–19:00** — Build Day work (optional but wonderful)
**19:00–20:00** — First meal together
**21:00** — Opening Circle (mandatory, transformative)
**21:30+** — Play begins softly

### Thursday+ Arrival

If you can't arrive Wednesday, you *must* arrive by **Thursday morning before the Consent Moment** (roughly 9:00 AM).

Late arrivals (Thursday afternoon+) miss the Opening Circle and Consent Moment, which shape how we hold the space. If you must arrive late, **contact us in advance** so we can support your integration.
