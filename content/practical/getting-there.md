## Early Arrival (Build Day)

### Why Arrive Early?

**Build Day is Wednesday starting around 14:00.** This is the best way to arrive because:
- Meet people before the intensity begins
- Help shape the space (hang lights, arrange comfort areas)
- Soften into the energy gradually
- Skip some of the arrival rush
- Get your pick of rooms/bunks

### Wednesday Arrival Flow

**14:00–18:00** — Arrive, check in, unload, settle into your room
**18:00–19:00** — Build Day work (optional but wonderful)
**19:00–20:00** — First meal together
**21:00** — Opening Circle (mandatory, transformative)
**21:30+** — Play begins softly

### Wednesday 21:00 is Mandatory

**You must arrive by Wednesday 21:00 for the Opening Circle.** This is not flexible.

This ritual is the threshold—it shapes how we hold space together, sets our collective agreements, and creates the energetic foundation for everything that follows.

If you cannot commit to being present Wednesday evening, this gathering isn't the right fit for you this year. We'd rather you honor your real capacity and join us when you can fully show up.

**No late arrivals.** Plan accordingly.
