### The food plan? Still simmering.

We’re still working out the final details, but here’s what we *do* know:

- There will be **coffee and water**, always.
- We’ll serve **bread in the morning**, **snacks** most afternoons, and **a warm meal every evening**.
- You'll choose **vegetarian** or **meat** when you register — and we’ll ask you to stick with your choice so we can plan portions.

This is *not* a gourmet weekend. But it will be tasty, filling, and made with love (and probably laughter).

### What About Special Diets?

We can accommodate **vegetarian** and **meat-based** meals — and we do our **best-effort vegan** too.  
While our kitchen isn’t fully equipped to handle every dietary need, we genuinely want to find solutions that work.

If you have specific requirements (vegan, gluten-free, allergies, etc.), reach out. We’re happy to collaborate and find something that suits you — whether that means adjusting ingredients or giving you access to kitchen space for your own prep.

We’re also assembling a **kitchen crew** — a small, scrappy team to help chop, stir, and keep the meals flowing. Want to be part of it? Stay tuned for sign-ups. It’s a great way to contribute, connect, and maybe pick up a few cooking secrets along the way.

### What Should You Bring?

- **Snacks & treats** — especially if you love sharing.  
- **Cooler box or insulated bag** — we’ll provide ice cubes.  
- **Your own drinks** — there’s no bar, so bring what you like.

We’ve tried bars in the past. It was a hassle. Most people brought their own anyway. So let’s keep it simple — bring your favorite drinks, a few to share, and we’ll help you keep them cold.

**Breakfast tip:** We’ll bring the bread. You bring what you like to put on it — cheese, jam, pindakaas, or whatever else fuels your morning glow.

### TL;DR

Bring a cooler. Bring your favorite drinks.  
Maybe a jar of Nutella.  
We’ve got the rest (mostly) covered.

More details coming soon — stay tuned, and stay hungry.
