## The Food Plan

**🍽️ What we provide:**
- **Coffee and water** — always available
- **Bread in the morning** — daily
- **Snacks** — most afternoons  
- **Warm meal** — every evening

**🥗 Dietary choice:**
You'll choose **vegetarian** or **meat** when you register — and we'll ask you to stick with your choice so we can plan portions.

This is *not* a gourmet weekend. But it will be tasty, filling, and made with love (and probably laughter).

## What Should You Bring?

**🛍️ Essential items:**
- **Snacks & treats** — especially if you love sharing  
- **Cooler box or insulated bag** — we'll provide ice cubes  
- **Your own drinks** — there's no bar, so bring what you like

**🍞 Breakfast tip:** We provide the bread. You bring what you like on it — cheese, jam, pindakaas, or whatever fuels your morning glow.

*We've tried bars before — it was a hassle and most people brought their own drinks anyway. Simple works better: bring your favorites, a few to share, and we'll have proper storage space.*

### TL;DR

Bring a cooler. Bring your favorite drinks.  
Maybe a jar of Nutella.  
We’ve got the rest (mostly) covered.

More details coming soon — stay tuned, and stay hungry.
