Anything beyond vegetarian or meat diets is not within our current kitchen capacity. If you have very specific nutrition needs \(vegan, gluten-free, organic\), we are very sorry but this event does not have the human resources or capacity to cater to your needs. We are open to helping you, though, and can provide those with specific needs access to the kitchen. 

As you can see, this is **not** a culinary event, but we're confident that, with your help, we can make this work. So, prepare your taste buds for some nice surprises. 


## What to Bring Yourself?
* Snacks and treats (also to share).
* A cooler. We will provide ice cubes!
* Your own drinks and sodas. Please note there will be **no bar** on site.

At the first event, we provided a bar for all attendees, but this was a huge hassle. Also, people have their preferences and in the end most people brought their own drinks anyway. Let's keep this up! Bring your cooler filled with your favorite drinks, some for you, some to share. We will provide ice-cubes free of charge to keep your beverages chilled.

**Breakfast:** as with drinks, provide your own favorite bread covering (cheese/meat/jam or even pindakaas). Put it in your cooler, and we'll provide the ice to keep it cool. Don't worry about bread, we'll provide you with fresh bread every morning.

Long story short, for the truly lazy people: bring your favorite drink, a cooler bag and a jar of Nutella, you'll be fine.
