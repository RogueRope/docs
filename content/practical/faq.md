## For First-Time Attendees

<details>
<summary><strong>I've never been to a rope gathering - is this suitable for beginners?</strong></summary>

Absolutely. We celebrate beginners and honor questions. You don't need to arrive confident or experienced - just curious and kind.

This isn't a place for experts - it's a place for the real. Read more on our [New Here?]({{< ref "/concept/new-here" >}}) page.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I have to participate in rope activities?</strong></summary>

Not at all. Rope is welcome, not required. Some people come just to feel the atmosphere, connect, watch, rest, or simply be part of the community.

You belong here as you are, with whatever level of participation feels right for you.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I come alone?</strong></summary>

Many people do! We'll help you find your way in through shared meals, structured activities, and spontaneous moments in common spaces. There are many gentle ways to connect.

You might leave with people you didn't know you needed. More on our [New Here?]({{< ref "/concept/new-here" >}}) page.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I feel overwhelmed during the event?</strong></summary>

We expect that this experience can be intense. There are quiet spaces, kind volunteers, and support available. You can always step away, take a breath, or ask for help.

Consent means you get to choose - every time. Learn about our support systems in [Wellbeing]({{< ref "/wellbeing" >}}).
</details>

## Community & Safety

<details>
<summary><strong>How do you handle consent and safety issues?</strong></summary>

Consent is central to everything we do. We have clear guidelines, trained support people, and systems for addressing concerns.

If something feels off or you witness concerning behavior, please tell us. We're committed to holding these situations with care.

Read our full [Consent page]({{< ref "/wellbeing/consent" >}}) and learn about our [Consent Crew]({{< ref "/wellbeing/consent-crew" >}}).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's the vetting process like?</strong></summary>

After you purchase a ticket, we ask for your FetLife name. We review profiles with care and respect, sometimes reaching out to our community for perspective. This helps ensure everyone feels safe and comfortable.

This process is completed for the vast majority of applicants. Full details on our [Tickets page]({{< ref "/practical/tickets" >}}).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I bring my partner or friend?</strong></summary>

Each person needs their own ticket and goes through the same vetting process. We encourage you to explore our community guidelines together, especially around [Consent]({{< ref "/wellbeing/consent" >}}) and what we expect from participants.

For relationship dynamics and considerations, see [Partners]({{< ref "/wellbeing/partners" >}}).

## Event Details

<details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's Build Day about?</strong></summary>

The gathering opens on **Tuesday** with Build Day - a chance to help set up spaces, hang lights, arrange lounges, and start connecting before the main event begins. It's about shared creation and early magic.

No special skills required, just your energy and willingness to help. Learn more at [Build Day]({{< ref "/practical/build-day" >}}).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Are there accommodation options besides communal sleeping?</strong></summary>

Yes. If communal sleeping isn't for you, there are nearby B&Bs and hotels. Some people choose a "hybrid approach" - sleeping off-site but participating in key shared rituals.

Tell us when you register and we'll help ensure you're still woven into the group fabric. Details on our [Accommodations page]({{< ref "/practical/accommodations" >}}).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I take photos or videos?</strong></summary>

Consent comes first, always. We have specific guidelines about photography and filming to protect everyone's privacy and comfort.

See our [Photography]({{< ref "/practical/filming-and-photography" >}}) page for complete guidelines.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's the unconference about?</strong></summary>

The unconference is peer-led sessions where participants share knowledge, lead discussions, or facilitate experiences. It's collaborative and emergent - shaped by who shows up and what they want to explore.

Learn more about this collaborative format on our [Unconference page]({{< ref "/practical/unconference" >}}).
