## The Gathering

**Is this just 4 days?** Yes. Wed 18:00 – Sun 16:00. Why short? 4 days is the sweet spot—long enough to settle, short enough to stay present.

**Can I arrive late/leave early?** Arrive by Thursday 9 AM (Consent Moment). Leaving early is fine. But the magic compounds—Day 1 is arrival, Days 2-3 are deepening, Day 4 is goodbye. Come anyway if you can only do 2-3 days.

**Do I have to do rope?** No. Watch, connect, rest, or play. All of it's welcome.

**Is this sexual?** Yes. Sex-positive, sexual interactions happen. If seeing others kiss, touch, or express sexuality makes you very uncomfortable, this isn't your event. We're clear because consent is mutual.

**Will I know anyone?** ~30% come solo. You'll meet people. By day 2, you'll know folks. By day 4, you're part of something.

## Safety & Boundaries

**Consent framework?** Ask before touch. Respect "no." Check in during play. Continuous, not one-time. [Full framework →]

**Consent violation?** Find Consent Crew (identified at opening circle). You're supported first. We take it seriously. You're believed.

**First aid?** Yes, trained responders on-site. Hospital in Mol (~10 min).

**Overwhelmed?** Quiet spaces available. Find an FWB (support person). Rest, cry, leave if needed. Your wellbeing comes first.
