## Getting Your Ticket

### Saying Yes (When You Mean It)

A ticket isn't just entry — it's commitment.  
To show up. To co-create. To meet this intensity with presence.

Securing your spot at Oh Bondage! Up Yours! is simple — but we ask that you move slowly. This isn't just about clicking "buy." It's about saying yes, with your whole self.

### Step 1: Read this first

If you've made it to this page, you've probably explored the rest of the site. (If not, we lovingly encourage you to pause and wander back through the other pages.)  

This isn't a spectator gathering. It's immersive. Real. Sometimes beautifully raw.  
We want you to arrive with your eyes wide open — excited, ready, and fully informed about what you're stepping into.

### Step 2: Reflect Before You Commit

Before you grab a ticket, take a breath.  
Ask yourself:

- Does this call to where I'm at right now?
- Will it nourish me — or stretch me too thin?
- Do I have the capacity (emotionally, physically, financially) to be fully present?

**FOMO is not a good reason to come.**  
You deserve more than that. And so does this space. This gathering asks for your full presence — not your anxious attendance.

Come because it's a yes in your gut.  
Not a maybe in your mind.

### Can't Afford It Right Now?

If money is the only thing standing between you and this experience, please reach out.  
We're open to real conversation — and committed to finding a solution that honors both your needs and ours.

That might mean a sliding scale, a payment plan, work exchange, or creative alternatives.  
No shame. No complicated applications. Just honest conversation and mutual care.

Email us at [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) and let us know what's manageable.  
We'll meet you where we can.

### Step 3: If it still feels right, request a ticket

If it's a yes — beautiful.

## Unconference: Share Your Gifts

### A Space for Sharing, Not Showing Off

Our unconference is a lightly held container for spontaneous brilliance, shared wisdom, and weird little things you didn't know you needed to talk about.

There's no set schedule. No official "teachers." Just a board, some post-its, and a collective invitation to explore together.

### The Four Unconference Rules

1. Whoever shows up are the right people.  
2. Whatever happens is the only thing that could have.  
3. Whenever it starts is the right time.  
4. It's over when it's over.

That's it. That's the magic.

### What Might You Offer?

No experts. Just people bringing what's alive.

What could you bring?
- A conversation you're hungry to have (e.g., navigating polyamory at gatherings)?
- A skillshare on something you love (e.g., giving a grounding massage, a specific rope technique)?
- A quiet, shared practice (e.g., a guided meditation or an hour of journaling together)?
- A deep dive into a tricky topic (e.g., power dynamics, aftercare, neurodivergence in play)?
- A question or body puzzle you want to explore with others?

We're here for the offbeat, the half-formed, the personal.  
If you care about it, someone else probably does too.
