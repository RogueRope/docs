### The Design?

Still under wraps.  
It might whisper. It might shout. It might make your friends ask questions.

We’ll reveal it closer to camp. Trust: it’ll be hot.

### How to Order

You’ll have the option to buy a shirt during the ticket checkout process. No need to decide now — but sizes will be limited, so best not to wait.

### Sizing

To get the right fit:
1. Find a shirt you love.
2. Lay it flat.
3. Measure it.
4. Compare with the charts below.

Choose what feels good on your body — classic cut or a shape with more space for boobs, bellies, or bounce.
