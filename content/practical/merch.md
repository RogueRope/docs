### The Design

A hand-drawn knot heart on deep plum.
"Oh Bondage! Up Yours!" coils around it in rough white lines.
It whispers and shouts all at once.

---

### How to Order

You’ll have the option to buy a shirt during the ticket checkout process. No need to decide now — but sizes will be limited, so best not to wait.

### Sizing

1. Find a shirt you love.
2. Lay it flat.
3. Measure it.
4. Compare with the charts below.
