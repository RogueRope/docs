### Saying Yes (When You Mean It)

A ticket isn't just entry — it's commitment.  
To show up. To co-create. To meet this intensity with presence.

Securing your spot at Oh Bondage! Up Yours! is simple — but we ask that you move slowly. This isn't just about clicking "buy." It's about saying yes, with your whole self.

## Step 1: Read this first

If you've made it to this page, you've probably explored the rest of the site. (If not, we lovingly encourage you to pause and wander back through the other pages.)  

This isn't a spectator gathering. It's immersive. Real. Sometimes beautifully raw.  
We want you to arrive with your eyes wide open — excited, ready, and fully informed about what you're stepping into.

## Step 2: Reflect Before You Commit

Before you grab a ticket, take a breath.  
Ask yourself:

- Does this call to where I’m at right now?
- Will it nourish me — or stretch me too thin?
- Do I have the capacity (emotionally, physically, financially) to be fully present?

**FOMO is not a good reason to come.**  
You deserve more than that. And so does this space. This gathering asks for your full presence — not your anxious attendance.

Come because it's a yes in your gut.  
Not a maybe in your mind.

### Can’t Afford It Right Now?

If money is the only thing standing between you and this experience, please reach out.  
We're open to real conversation — and committed to finding a solution that honors both your needs and ours.

That might mean a sliding scale, a payment plan, work exchange, or creative alternatives.  
No shame. No complicated applications. Just honest conversation and mutual care.

Email us at [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) and let us know what’s manageable.  
We’ll meet you where we can.

## Step 3: If it still feels right, request a ticket

If it's a yes — beautiful.  

**📅 Tickets go on sale: May 5th at 20:00**

## Step 4: Vetting

To help keep our space safe and aligned with our values, we ask for your **FetLife name** during the ticket process.  

**Our vetting process:**
- ✅ Review your FetLife profile with care and respect
- ✅ Reach out to our community for perspective if needed  
- ✅ Contact you directly if we have any questions or concerns

This isn't about judgment — it's about ensuring everyone feels comfortable and safe. **The vast majority of applicants are confirmed.** Once approved, we'll send payment instructions by email.

This is where it starts.  
Not the tying. Not the fire. Not the tears.  

Right here — with a choice.  
A yes. A thread picked up.

Still unsure? That’s okay.

Take a moment to read more about how we [care for each other]({{< ref "/wellbeing" >}}),  
or what this experience will ask of you, practically and emotionally, in the [Preparation section]({{< ref "/practical" >}}).

No pressure.  
Just clarity.

We can’t wait to see who joins us.
