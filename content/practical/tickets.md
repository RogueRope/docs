### How to Join Us

Securing your spot at Rogue Rope Camp is simple — but we ask that you move slowly.  
This isn’t just about clicking “buy.” It’s about saying yes, with your whole self.

---

## Step 1: Know What You’re Saying Yes To

If you’ve made it to this page, you’ve probably explored the rest of the site. (If not, we gently ask you to pause and go back.)  

This isn’t a spectator event. It’s immersive. Real. Sometimes raw.  
We want you to arrive with your eyes wide open — excited, ready, and informed.

---

## Step 2: Reflect Before You Commit

Before you grab a ticket, take a breath.  
Ask yourself:

- Does this call to where I’m at right now?
- Will it nourish me — or stretch me too thin?
- Do I have the capacity (emotionally, physically, financially) to be fully present?

**FOMO is not a good reason to come.**  
You deserve more than that. And so does this space.

Come because it’s a yes in your gut.  
Not a maybe in your mind.

### Can’t Afford It Right Now?

If money is the only thing standing in your way, please reach out.  
We’re open to dialogue — and ready to find a solution that works for you.

That might mean a discount, a payment plan, or the option to pay later.  
No shame. No hoops. Just conversation and care.

Email us at [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) and let us know what’s manageable.  
We’ll meet you where we can.

## Step 3: Buy Your Ticket

If it’s a yes — beautiful.  
Tickets go on sale **May 5th at 20:00**.

👉 [Buy your ticket here](https://shop.gogogonzo.be/RRC25/)

You’ll be asked to provide a name at checkout (for legal/accounting reasons).  
Use your real name, a chosen name, or a pseudonym — whatever you feel comfortable with.

---

## Step 4: Vetting

To help keep our space safe and aligned, we ask for your **FetLife name** during the ticket process.  

After you place your order, we’ll:
- Review your FetLife profile  
- Reach out to our community if needed  
- Contact you if we have any concerns

Once you're confirmed, we’ll send payment instructions by email.

This is where it starts.  
Not the tying. Not the fire. Not the tears.  

Right here — with a choice.  
A yes. A thread picked up.

---

Still unsure? That’s okay.

Take a moment to read more about how we [care for each other]({{< ref "/wellbeing" >}}),  
or what this experience will ask of you, practically and emotionally, in the [Preparation section]({{< ref "/practical" >}}).

No pressure.  
Just clarity.

We can’t wait to see who joins us.
