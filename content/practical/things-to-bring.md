### The Basics

- Water bottle or hydration container
- Your favorite snacks or specialty food items
- Drinks you love — with or without alcohol
- Cooler bag or box + space in your heart for ice (we’ll provide that part)

### Winter Comfort & Warmth
- **Bedding for your bunk** — sleeping bag, sheets, blankets, whatever makes you cozy
- **Pillow** — inflatable or your favorite from home  
- **Warm layers** — it's February, dress accordingly
- **Cozy clothes** for lounging in common areas
- **Slippers or warm socks** — indoor floors can be cold
- Lights or fairy strings to make your bunk space magical

### Indoor Living Essentials
- **Personal items** for your bunk space
- Blanket for common area snuggling
- Something comfortable for group activities
- **Earplugs** — dormitory life can be... social

- Toothbrush + toothpaste
- Quick-dry towel
- Hand sanitizer
- Any prescription meds you need
- Useful over-the-counter stuff (painkillers, allergy meds, etc.)
- First aid basics (band-aids, antiseptic, electrolytes)

### Self-Care & Sanity
- Ear plugs (you might be tented near a snorer)
- Sleeping mask (sunrise is early)
- Sunscreen (SPF 30+)
- Hat, scarf, or shawl for shade
- Sunglasses
- Insect repellent
- Portable phone charger / power bank
- Charging cables for your stuff
- A **trash bag** for your own waste (no bins on site!)
- A **portable ashtray** if you smoke

### Dressing for Winter Delight
- **Warm layers** — think February in Belgium
- Indoor clothes you can move, tie, and play in
- An [outfit for the play party](/dresscode)
- **Winter outerwear** for any outdoor activities
- Something that makes you feel hot, silly, or sacred (despite the cold)

### Food Planning

We’ve got meals in motion — check the [Food section]({{<ref "food.md" >}}) for what’s provided and what to bring.

## Please Leave These at Home

- Kids (<18j)
- Pets (even the cute ones)
- Megaphones
- **Personal heaters** (fire hazard in shared spaces)
- Devices that drain excessive power
- Summer camping gear (you won't need it!)
- Bad vibes
- Expectations of hotel-level privacy

Bring what makes you feel safe, curious, and alive.  
And don’t forget your rope.
