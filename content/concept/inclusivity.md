## Financial Accessibility

We believe that financial constraints shouldn't prevent anyone from experiencing Rogue Rope Camp If the cost is a barrier for you, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're committed to finding a solution that works for you, whether that's a payment plan or a pay-what-you-can-ticket. Let's talk and make it possible for you to join us.

## Mental Wellness Consideration

Rogue Rope Camp offers an immersive and intense experience, sometimes challenging to both neurotypical and atypical participants. We recognize that the full duration may not be suitable for everyone due to its intensity. Therefore, while all are required to begin their journey with us on Thursday evening, we fully support those who decide to leave early if they feel overwhelmed. **FOMO is real**, but prioritizing **self-care is vital**. 
We encourage everyone to acknowledge their limits and make the most of their time with us at their own pace.

## Discrimination-Free Zone

At Rogue Rope Camp, discrimination has no place. We stand for a community where LGBTQ+ individuals, people of all ethnicities, ages, and abilities feel safe and valued. We strive to create an environment where you can be your authentic self, without fear or reservation.

## Tailoring the Experience to Your Needs

Your comfort and participation are important to us. If there's something specific that would enable you to attend or enjoy the event more fully, let us know. We're eager to learn and accommodate wherever possible. Accessibility, interpretive services, or any other needs - if we can make it work, we will. Reach out to us at [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be) with your needs or suggestions.

Let's make Rogue Rope Camp a space where everyone belongs and thrives.
