This is a space for many.  
But not for all.

Rogue Rope Camp welcomes queerness, neurodivergence, kink, softness, weirdness, and everything else that doesn't fit cleanly into polite society. We hold space for shadow and play, for bodies that don’t match expectations, for desires that don’t ask permission.

But we also hold standards. And we are not afraid to say no.

This is not a place for entitlement, for ego, for domination without consent.  
It is not a place for people who bristle at boundaries.  
It is not a place for those who can’t hold themselves accountable.

If you’re here to connect — for real — you’re welcome.  
If you’re here to control, consume, or coast, you’re not.

### Access Is Not the Same as Entitlement

We do our best to make this space financially and physically accessible.  
**If money is the barrier, reach out.** We’re ready to open a conversation and find something that works for you.

Maybe that’s a discount.  
Maybe it’s paying later.  
Maybe it’s installments or trade.  
We don’t do shame. We do dialogue.

Email us at [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be).  
Tell us what’s manageable — and we’ll see what’s possible.

But access is a *shared responsibility.*  
You still need to show up. To care for yourself and the people around you. To be ready for the emotional and logistical demands of a space like this.

If you’re not sure you’re ready — that’s okay.  
Better to wait than to overextend.

### The Intensity Is Real

This isn’t a light weekend.  
It’s immersive. Emotional. Sensory. Beautiful — and intense.

Some people stay the whole time. Some people leave early. That’s fine. We support pacing and self-care. We encourage honest reflection before you sign up. Are you in a place to give and receive in community?

This space will hold you — if you also hold it.

### Boundaries Make Belonging Possible

We are actively queer-inclusive. Kink-aware. Neuro-friendly. Body-positive. And we mean it. But inclusion doesn’t mean anything without boundaries.

We’ve said no before. We’ll say no again.  
Because harm, manipulation, or repeated disregard for consent are not part of this camp — and won’t be tolerated.

If you’ve been removed from this space before, or made someone feel unsafe here: know that we remember. We investigate reports. We prioritize care over comfort.

### Tell Us What You Need — If You're Ready to Be Here

If something would help you feel more safe or supported — we want to hear it. Accessibility needs, translation help, neuro support, emotional check-ins — we’re here for it.

Reach out at [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be). We’ll do what we can. If we can’t meet your need, we’ll be honest about that too.

Rogue Rope Camp is built on trust.  
Trust that you’ll show up with care.  
Trust that when you fuck up, you’ll own it.  
Trust that your presence is a gift — not a demand.

If that resonates: welcome.  
If not: this might not be your place.
