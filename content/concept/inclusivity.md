This is a space for many.
But not for all.

Oh Bondage! Up Yours! welcomes queerness, neurodivergence, kink, softness, weirdness, and everything else that doesn't fit neatly into polite society. We hold space for shadow and play, for bodies that don't match expectations, for desires that don't ask permission.

We want you here if you come with curiosity.
We want you here if you long for honesty, connection, or the freedom to be as you are.
We want you here if you're ready to meet others with care, and to be met in return.

But let's be clear:

This is not a place for entitlement, for ego, or for domination without consent.
It's not a place for people who won’t respect boundaries.
It's not a place for those unwilling to take responsibility for their impact.

If you're here to connect — for real — you're welcome.
If you're here to control, consume, or detach, you're not.

## Access Is Not the Same as Entitlement

We do our best to make this space financially and physically accessible.
**If money is the barrier, reach out.** We're ready to talk and find something that works.

Maybe that's a discount.
Maybe installments.
Maybe a trade.

We don't do shame. We do dialogue.

But access is a *shared responsibility*.
You still need to show up with presence. To tend to yourself and the people around you. To be ready for the intensity this space brings.

If you're not sure you're ready — that's okay.
Better to pause than to force it.

## The Intensity Is Real

This isn't a light weekend.
It's immersive. Emotional. Sensory. Beautiful — and intense.

Some people stay the whole time. Some leave early. Both are valid.

We support pacing and self-care. We encourage reflection before you say yes:
Are you in a place to give and receive in community?
To risk being seen as you are?

This space will hold you — if you also hold it.

## Boundaries Make Belonging Possible

We are actively queer-inclusive. Kink-aware. Neuro-friendly. Body-positive.

But inclusion without boundaries is meaningless.
We've said no before. We'll say no again.

Harm, manipulation, or repeated disregard for consent are not part of this gathering — and won't be tolerated.

If you've been removed from this space before, or made someone feel unsafe here: know that we remember. We investigate. We act with care — and with firmness.

## Tell Us What You Need — If You're Ready to Be Here

If something would help you feel safer or more supported, tell us. Accessibility needs, neuro-support, translation help, emotional check-ins — we want to hear.

Reach out at [info@roguerope.be](mailto:info@roguerope.be).
We'll do what we can. And if we can't meet your need, we'll be honest about that too.

Oh Bondage! Up Yours! is built on trust.
Trust that you'll show up with care.
Trust that when you fuck up, you'll own it.
Trust that your presence is a gift — not a demand.

If that resonates, you're welcome here.
We want you here.
And we can't wait to meet you.
