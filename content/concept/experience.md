## The Flow of Our Days

**A rough outline. We'll adjust to what the camp needs.**

This isn't a scheduled program. It's a gentle container for what wants to emerge when people show up fully present, ready to connect, and willing to be real.

## Wednesday Afternoon – Build Begins

Come early if you can.
Not because we need help (though we do), but because this is one of the best ways to arrive.

There's something sacred about shaping the space before it holds us.
Hanging lights. Painting signs. Arranging the lounge areas.
Making coffee. Making eye contact. Making meaning.

No skills required. Just hands. Just heart. Just presence.

## Wednesday – We Land

This is arrival day.
**Everyone is expected to arrive by Wednesday evening.**
Get settled in your space. Shake off the outside world. Step in slowly.

And then, as night falls:  
**The Opening Circle begins at 21:00.**  
This is a sacred threshold — a moment of collective breath, of shared arrival.  
Your presence matters. Be on time. Be all in.

Play begins after the circle, softly.

We ask you to begin with us. But you don't have to stay until the end.

If you find yourself overwhelmed, exhausted, complete — **it's okay to leave early**.  
We honor your limits. We celebrate your self-awareness.  
Tapping out is not failure. It's wisdom.

You know yourself best. We trust you.

## Thursday to Saturday – We Unfold

We begin Thursday morning with our **Consent Moment** —  
a guided, embodied check-in.  
Not just reminders, but rituals.  
It's mandatory. And it's meaningful.

From there, the days stretch open.

Jam spaces. Lounge whispers. Quiet rituals. Late-night laughter.
Rope in the space. Kisses in the dim light. Gentle movements. Soft eyes. Stillness. Play.

There will be peer-led offerings — nothing scheduled yet, everything possible.  
And we won't leave it all to chance.

---

## Sunday – We Unravel

For many, this is the soft close.
We gather our things. Tears come up.
We hold each other. We say goodbye.

But not everyone makes it to Sunday — and that's okay.

If you leave early, we'll miss you.
And we'll honor your choice.

Some people stay the whole time.
Some people leave halfway through.
Both are valid. Both are brave.

What matters is that you came at all.

## The Playground Is Wide

## Rope Is Just the Beginning

Yes, we love rope.  
But that's just the surface.

This is a space to play — with power, with surrender, with sensation, with self.  
It's a place where desire can stretch its legs. Where you can experiment, express, and explore without needing to perform.

Rope is our common language.  
But the dialects? Endless.

You don't need to be "good" at it.  
You don't need to know the names of the knots.  
You don't even need to tie.  
Curiosity is enough. Presence is enough. You are enough.

Come with an open body and a listening heart. That's all we ask.

### This is Not a Technical Skills Gathering

This is a living, breathing permission slip.

You'll find whips and wax, needles and nails, floggers and fire.  
You'll find the softest hands and the filthiest mouths.  
You'll find silence. You'll find sound.  
You'll find scenes that don't look like scenes at all — just two people, breathing together, holding a secret.

Nudity is welcome.  
Sexuality is not hidden.  
You don't have to dim your shine, your heat, your hunger.

This is a place where kink lives beside care.  
Where sex is sacred and messy and not up for anyone else's consumption.  
Where play can look like fucking — or crying — or lying in intimate embrace, wrapped in rope and connection, with someone watching over you.
