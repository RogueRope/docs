_Oh Bondage! Up Yours!_ arrives with intimate warmth — raw, playful, and wide open. This isn't a weekend of workshops. It's a living, breathing space for connection. For exploration. For erotic truth in shared sanctuary.

### Embracing Eros

We don’t shy away from it.  
We invite it.

Sexuality isn’t an afterthought here. It’s part of the fabric. Part of the rope. Part of what makes shibari more than technique — what makes it pulse with meaning. Without eros, rope is just knots. With it, it becomes a ritual of longing and play and truth.

This is not a place for performance.  
It’s a space for personal expression — messy, beautiful, and yours.

### Rope in Intimate Spaces

The setting changes everything.
You feel it when the atmosphere envelops your scene. When you move with intention in shared space. When rope becomes the bridge between souls in this carefully held container.

Here, we let go of the studio rules. We create suspension from within. We breathe in connection and presence and laughter. The space becomes part of the play — intimate, alive, and endlessly welcoming.

### Peer-Led and Pressure-Free

We don’t divide people into experts and beginners. No badges, no titles, no status games.

What we offer is a field full of possibility — where learning happens through doing, watching, asking, laughing. Where you can stumble into a new skill during a late-night knot, or feel your heart open in a casual cuddle pile. Where generosity replaces hierarchy.

We believe everyone has something to share.  
And sometimes, the best thing you can bring is your presence.

### Not Just Learning — Becoming

This isn’t about downloading information.  
It’s about transformation.

We don’t chase productivity. We don’t sell certainty. What we’re building is a community of risk-takers and tenderness-makers. People who want to feel more, not just know more.

At Oh Bondage! Up Yours!, you won’t leave with a certificate.  
You might leave changed.

Come if you're ready for something real.
Come if you're craving something deeply connective.
Come if you want to feel rope not just on your skin — but in your soul.
