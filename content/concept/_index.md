### Intro


At Rogue Rope Camp, we’ve taken care of **the basics**: a spacious outdoor venue to host our events, tents for a cozy night’s sleep, and of course, the ropes and suspension points for our central theme. Add to this mix a sound system for ambiance, and basic amenities for comfort.

But, as always, it’s the heartbeats of all participants that elevate this gathering to its true potential. Whether you’re sharing insights in our unconference, tying or getting tied, or simply being present in the moment, **your presence and energy** are what will make these days memorable.

This event may present an **intense experience** and might not be everyone’s cup of tea. It’s crucial for attendees to align with the ethos and intent behind Rogue Rope Camp. However, **if you’re keen to explore, connect, and contribute**, we’re excited to welcome you.

What sets _Rogue Rope Camp_ apart is our **unique approach**. We are **not** about accumulating new knowledge through workshops; instead, our focus is on utilizing the knowledge that participants already possess to create **profound experiences**. It’s about bringing your personal understanding of rope into a shared space where **skills become a means to facilitate deeper human connection**. Bring your experience, your openness, and let’s weave together moments that not only last for the days we’re together but linger in our memories, our senses, and our bonds.

We’re eager to embark on this new journey with our cherished friends. **Together, let’s craft an event that resonates, connects, and celebrates the depth of the bottom’s journey in rope.**
