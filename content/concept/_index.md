# The Heart of Our Gathering

## More Than Rope

**Oh Bondage! Up Yours!** began with a simple question: *What if we created a space where connection matters more than performance?*

This isn't about showcasing skills or chasing aesthetic perfection. This is about the quiet moments between ties, the conversations that happen in vulnerability, the trust that builds when consent is truly central.

Rope is our medium, but connection is our art.

  <p class="callout-title">🌿 Our Core Values</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consent as Foundation</strong> — Not just asked, but enthusiastic, ongoing, and sacred</li>
    <li><strong>Connection Over Performance</strong> — Depth matters more than spectacle</li>
    <li><strong>Vulnerability as Strength</strong> — Creating safety for authentic expression</li>
    <li><strong>Community as Container</strong> — We hold each other through it all</li>
    <li><strong>Growth Through Experience</strong> — Learning happens in practice, not just theory</li>
  </ul>

## The Winter Edition Vision

As we move indoors for our winter gathering, we're creating something intentionally different:

### Intimacy by Design
Smaller spaces. Shared accommodations. Longer conversations. The cold outside draws us closer together inside, fostering bonds that outdoor summer camps simply can't match.

### Ritual Over Routine
Every workshop, every practice session, every meal becomes an opportunity for presence. We slow down. We notice. We honor the sacredness in the mundane.

### Warmth in Darkness
Winter asks us to turn inward. To rest. To reflect. Our retreat honors this seasonal wisdom, creating space not just for doing, but for being.

## What "Consent as Sacred Practice" Actually Means

We don't just talk about consent — we build a culture around it:

- **Before Every Interaction** — Explicit negotiation is normalized, not awkward
- **During Every Connection** — Check-ins are woven into practice, not interruptions
- **After Every Experience** — Debrief and integration are valued parts of the process
- **In Every Space** — From workshops to meals to downtime, boundaries are honored

Consent isn't a checkbox. It's a conversation. It's a practice. It's how we love each other.

## Who We Are (And Who We're Becoming)

This gathering attracts:
- Rope enthusiasts seeking depth beyond technique
- Kink-curious folks wanting safer entry points
- Experienced practitioners craving authentic connection
- Humans hungry for community that actually feels like community

**You don't need to be an expert. You don't need to have it all figured out. You just need to show up with curiosity, respect, and an open heart.**
