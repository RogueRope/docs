This isn't for everyone. That's not a judgment — it's design.

Oh Bondage! Up Yours! works best when people arrive knowing what they're stepping into. So let's get honest about who thrives here and who might find what they need elsewhere.

## Are You Craving This?

**✨ Deeper connection in your rope practice?**  
This isn't about learning more knots or perfecting technique. It's about finding the intimacy, presence, and emotional resonance that make rope feel sacred.

**🤝 Authentic community over surface performance?**  
We value real conversation over rope tricks. Vulnerability over Instagram moments. Being seen for who you are rather than what you can do.

**🕊️ Safety that goes beyond physical technique?**  
We create space for consent that's enthusiastic, ongoing, and held collectively. Emotional safety matters as much as physical safety here.

**🌅 Time to slow down and feel deeply?**  
Four days to step away from rush culture. To breathe. To be present. To let intimacy unfold naturally without agenda or timeline.

## You'll Love This If...

**You're curious about rope** — whether you've never touched it or you've been tying for years. Experience level doesn't matter. Openness does.

**You value consent as an ongoing practice** — not just a checkbox, but a living dialogue that deepens intimacy and trust.

**You want to connect with like-minded people** — folks who see kink as a doorway to deeper humanity, not just a bedroom activity.

**You're comfortable with communal living** — shared meals, bunk beds, morning coffee conversations with people you just met.

**You can hold space for others' emotions** — tears, laughter, overwhelm, and joy are all welcome parts of this experience.

**You're ready to be fully present** — phones away, agendas aside, heart open to whatever wants to emerge.

## This Might Not Be Right If...

**You're looking for a rope workshop or skill-building event** — we're about connection, not curriculum. You'll learn plenty, but through experience rather than instruction.

**You prefer anonymous encounters** — this is intimate, communal, and heart-centered. People see and remember each other here.

**You need privacy and solitude** — we sleep in shared rooms, eat together, and spend most of our time in community.

**You're not ready to engage with emotions** — rope brings up feelings. Ours, others', unexpected ones. We hold that tenderly, but it happens.

**You're seeking a party atmosphere** — this is contemplative, intentional, and sometimes quiet. Fun, yes. Wild party, no.

## Still Wondering?

Ask yourself:

💭 **Does this gathering feel like coming home to something I've been seeking?**

💭 **Am I ready to be vulnerable and hold space for others' vulnerability?**

💭 **Do I want to explore rope as a practice of intimacy and presence?**

💭 **Can I commit to four days of authentic engagement with a community?**

If you're feeling "YES" — even a nervous, excited, uncertain yes — then this might be exactly what you need.

If you're feeling "maybe" or "I'm not sure" — that's perfectly valid too. Trust your instincts. There are many beautiful gatherings in the world. This one might not be yours right now, and that's okay.
