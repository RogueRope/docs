### The Rhythm of Rogue

We are still building the shedule, but here’s what *is* known:

---

## Tuesday  
**Build begins.**  
Come early if you can — not because we need experts, but because we believe in shared beginnings. No special skills required. No heavy lifting unless you want it. Just many hands, many hearts, and a chance to help shape the space before it holds us.

Hang a light. Paint a sign. Tie some fabric. Make coffee. Offer vibes.
It’s one of the best ways to meet people, ease into the rhythm, and start connecting before things officially begin.

---

## Wednesday  
**Evening arrival is mandatory.**  
This is when we land — together. The opening ritual starts at around 21.00. We expect you to be there.

---

## Sunday  
**We leave.**  
Teardown, hugs, tears, and soft goodbyes. The camp dissolves, but something stays with you.
