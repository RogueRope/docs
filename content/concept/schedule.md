### The Rhythm of Rogue

We don’t run on a clock.  
We move with breath. With bodies. With whatever the moment asks for.

But here’s the rhythm we’re weaving toward — not a program, but a pulse.

---

## Tuesday – **Build Begins**

Come early if you can.  
Not because we need help (though we do), but because this is one of the best ways to arrive.

There’s something sacred about shaping the space before it holds us.  
Hanging lights. Painting signs. Tying fabric between trees.  
Making coffee. Making eye contact. Making meaning.

No skills required. Just hands. Just heart. Just presence.

---

## Wednesday – **We Land**

This is arrival day.  
**Everyone is expected to arrive by Wednesday evening.**  
Set up your tent. Shake off the outside world. Step in slowly.

And then, as night falls:  
**The Opening Circle begins at 21:00.**  
This is a sacred threshold — a moment of collective breath, of shared arrival.  
Your presence matters. Be on time. Be all in.

Play begins after the circle, softly.

We ask you to begin with us. But you don’t have to stay until the end.

If you find yourself overwhelmed, exhausted, complete — **it’s okay to leave early**.  
We honor your limits. We celebrate your self-awareness.  
Tapping out is not failure. It’s wisdom.

You know yourself best. We trust you.

## Thursday to Saturday – **We Unfold**

We begin Thursday morning with our **Consent Moment** —  
a guided, embodied check-in.  
Not just reminders, but rituals.  
It’s mandatory. And it’s meaningful.

From there, the days stretch open.

Jam spaces. Fireside whispers. Quiet rituals. Late-night laughter.  
Rope in the grass. Kisses in the dark. Long walks. Soft eyes. Stillness. Play.

There will be peer-led offerings — nothing scheduled yet, everything possible.  
And we won’t leave it all to chance.

The organizing team will offer gentle structures to help you step outside your bubble —  
to spark connection, to ease first contact, to help you meet someone you didn’t know you needed.

These aren’t games. They’re invitations.  
Crafted with care. Designed to open doors, not force them.

Say yes. Say no. Say maybe later.  
There’s room for all of it.

Let yourself be found.  
Let yourself unfold.

---

## Sunday – **We Unravel**

For many, this is the soft close.  
Tents come down. Tears come up.  
We hold each other. We say goodbye.

But not everyone makes it to Sunday — and that’s okay.

If you leave early, we’ll miss you.  
And we’ll honor your choice.

Some people stay the whole time.  
Some people leave halfway through.  
Both are valid. Both are brave.

What matters is that you came at all.

### Notes

- **Wednesday 21:00:** Mandatory Opening Circle  
- **Thursday morning:** Mandatory Consent Moment  
- **Play begins after Wednesday’s ritual**  
- Expect light structure to support new connections — rituals, icebreakers, and soft invitations to meet each other  
- All other offerings are peer-led, optional, and spontaneous  
- The schedule is loose — because your body knows better than a clock

Come for the week.  
Stay for the moments you didn’t know you needed.
