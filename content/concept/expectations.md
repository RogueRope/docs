We built this camp to hold us.  
But a space alone isn’t enough.  
It’s the people — and the agreements between us — that make it work.

This isn’t a list of rules.  
It’s a shared invitation.

To show up.  
To take care.  
To be brave, soft, honest, and kind.

### What we ask of you:

**Consent comes first. Always.**  
Get it clearly. Give it freely. Pay attention to the yes — and the no. Tune into body language, not just words. Be grateful when someone trusts you with their truth.

**Respect the humans around you.**  
Every person here carries their own story. Be mindful. Be curious. Don’t assume. Honor pronouns. Ask before touching. Celebrate difference.

**Speak what’s real.**  
Say what you mean. Hear what’s said. Communicate openly, especially when the stakes feel high. Clarity is care.

**Stay present.**  
Rogue Rope Camp is immersive for a reason. Let the outside world wait. Be here — with your body, your breath, your attention.

**Be generous.**  
Offer help when you can. Share your skills, your music, your mischief. This is a co-created space — your contribution matters, whether it’s tying a knot or washing a pot.

**Own your impact.**  
If you mess up (and we all do), take responsibility. Apologize without defensiveness. Repair if needed. Growth lives in the aftermath.

**Play with awareness.**  
BDSM, sex, and kink are welcome here — but never at the cost of safety or consent. Know your limits. Respect others'. Be gentle with power.

**Conflict happens.**  
If something goes wrong, don’t let it fester. We’ve got people here who can help. Mediation is available. So is care. So is space.

**Take care of yourself.**  
Eat. Hydrate. Rest. Ask for what you need. You’re not a machine. You don’t have to do everything. Let your body guide you.

**Leave room for magic.**  
Not everything needs to be planned. Stay open to the unexpected. Some of the most beautiful moments begin with "I didn’t know I needed this.”

If we all show up like this — with presence, with care —  
we create something rare.  
A place where people feel safe.  
A place where connection runs deep.  
A place you’ll want to return to, not just in memory, but in your bones.

Let’s build that together.
