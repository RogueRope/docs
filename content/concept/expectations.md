We built this camp to hold us.  
But a space alone isn’t enough.  
It’s the people — and the agreements between us — that make it real.

This isn’t a list of rules.  
It’s an invitation.

To show up.  
To take care.  
To be brave, and soft, and honest.  
To be kind — especially when it’s hard.

---

### What we ask of you:

**Consent comes first. Always.**  
Get it clearly. Give it freely. Tune in to words and to silence.  
Be grateful when someone trusts you with their truth.

**Respect the humans around you.**  
Every person here carries a story.  
Be mindful. Be curious. Ask before touching. Honor pronouns. Celebrate difference.

**Speak what’s real.**  
Say what you mean. Hear what’s said.  
When things feel tender, choose clarity. It’s a form of care.

**Stay present.**  
Let the outside world wait. Be here — with your body, your breath, your attention.

**Be generous.**  
Offer what you can: your time, your skills, your mischief, your warmth.  
It all counts — from tying a knot to stirring the soup.

**Own your impact.**  
We all fuck up. What matters is what you do next.  
Apologize. Repair. Learn. Grow.

**Play with awareness.**  
Kink, sex, BDSM — they’re welcome here.  
But never at the cost of safety or consent.  
Know your edges. Respect others’. Be gentle with power.

**Conflict happens.**  
Don’t let it fester. We have people who can help.  
Mediation is available. So is care. So is space.

**Take care of yourself.**  
Eat. Hydrate. Rest.  
Ask for what you need.  
You’re not here to push through — you’re here to be whole.

**Leave room for magic.**  
Some moments can’t be planned.  
The best ones often begin with: “I didn’t know I needed this.”

If we show up like this — with presence, with care —  
we create something rare.  
A place where people feel safe.  
A place where connection runs deep.  
A place that lives in your bones long after you leave.

Let’s build that. Together.
