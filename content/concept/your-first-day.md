## Wednesday Afternoon – Arrival & Build

**14:00–18:00** — Arrive whenever you can

- **Check-in:** Find the welcome table near the main entrance
- **You'll get:** Your room assignment, welcome packet with map, meal schedule
- **Settle in:** Go to your room, meet your roommates, arrange your bunk
- **Find the energy:** Explore common areas, grab a coffee, chat with early arrivals

**18:00–19:00** — Build Day (optional but magical)

- Hang lights, arrange lounge areas, set up the space
- Meet people while working side-by-side
- No skills needed — just hands and heart
- Most people who arrive early say this is when the magic starts

**19:00–20:00** — First Meal Together

- Dinner is communal — we all eat in the main space
- Find a seat, meet neighbors, shake off the outside world
- This meal is warm, filling, made with care

**20:30–21:00** — Settling In

- Return to your room, get comfortable
- Use the bathroom, brush your teeth, get ready
- Chat quietly with roommates
- The energy is building

## Wednesday Evening – Opening Circle

**21:00** — Opening Circle (Required)

This is the threshold. The moment we step in together.

**What happens:**
- We gather in a circle (all 42 of us)
- Introduction from organizers (what we're about)
- Consent Moment (embodied practice)
- How the space works (agreements, support, how to find help)
- We land together
- Takes about 45 minutes

**Why attend:** This ritual shapes everything that follows. It's not a lecture; it's a collective breath.

**After the circle:**
- Play might begin softly (some rope, some hanging out)
- You can participate or head to bed — both are fine
- The night is open-ended

## Thursday Morning – You're Here

You've slept (or listened to roommates sleep).

**9:00 AM** — Consent Moment (reinforcement)

A guided, embodied practice refreshing and deepening the consent framework from the Opening Circle. Short, meaningful.

**After that:**
- Breakfast/coffee in common area
- Jam spaces open (people tying, connecting)
- Unconference board posted (see what peer-led sessions are happening)
- You settle into the rhythm

You don't need to be ready. You just need to be here.

Come as you are. We'll meet you there.
