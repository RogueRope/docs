We don’t do spectators here.  
We do co-creation.  
That means this isn’t something we build *for* you — it’s something we build *with* you.

Everyone gives a little.  
Everyone gets a lot.

### What counts as participation?

All of it.

Chopping onions.  
Hanging lights.  
Sweeping glitter.  
Holding someone who needs to cry.  
Tying rope, sharing a song, offering your favorite snack at 3am.

There is no competition here.  
No one gets a gold star.  
Contribution looks different for everyone — and that’s the point.

Whether you’re a helper, a dreamer, a mischief-maker, or someone who simply holds the energy of care in a space... you belong.

### Volunteering = Love in Action

We ask everyone to take part in a short volunteer shift — a way to anchor your presence in this shared container. It’s not a job. It’s a spell. A ripple of care that touches more people than you’ll ever know.

You don’t have to lead a workshop or be extroverted.  
You just have to be here. With intention.

### Together, We Make the Magic

This camp lives and breathes through what we all bring.  
The way you show up changes the space.

So come as you are.  
Bring what you have.  
Offer it freely.  
Receive what flows back.

Let’s build something unforgettable. Together.
