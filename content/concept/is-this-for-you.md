# New Here? Welcome.

Maybe you've never been to a rope gathering before.  
Maybe you've never been naked in public.  
Maybe you've never shared intimate space with strangers.  
Maybe you've never said out loud that you're kinky.  
Maybe you're not even sure if you are.

**That's okay.**

You don't have to arrive confident. Or experienced. Or loud.  
You don't have to tie. You don't have to undress. You don't have to explain.  
You just have to be curious. And kind. And willing to feel.

## This is Not a Place for Experts

This is a place for the real.

We've built Bottoms Up! for the ones who want something more. Not flashier. Not sexier. But **truer**.

If you're worried you won't know how to start a conversation — you're not alone. Most of us have felt that. So we've created icebreakers, gentle encounters, and open spaces that make it easier to connect. No games, no pressure. Just invitations.

If you're afraid you'll be the only one who doesn't know how it all works — you won't be. We celebrate beginners. We honor questions. We welcome quiet.

**You belong here as you are.**

### What if I don't want to do rope?

That's fine. Truly. Rope is the thread, not the whole fabric. Some people come just to feel the atmosphere. To connect. To flirt. To cry. To kiss. To watch. To rest.

Rope is welcome. Not required.

### What if I'm coming alone?

A lot of people do. We'll help you find your way in. Whether through shared meals, structured play spaces, or spontaneous moments in shared spaces, there are many ways to connect — slowly, gently, honestly.

You might leave with people you didn't know you needed.

### What if I feel overwhelmed?

We expect that. This experience can be intense. There are quiet places, kind volunteers, and soft hands if you need them. You can always step away, lie down, take a breath, cry, laugh, or ask for help.

Consent means you get to choose — every time.

## Who Is This For?

This isn't for everyone. That's not a judgment — it's design.

Bottoms Up! works best when people arrive knowing what they're stepping into. So let's get honest about who thrives here and who might find what they need elsewhere.

### Are You Craving This?

**✨ Deeper connection in your rope practice?**  
This isn't about learning more knots or perfecting technique. It's about finding the intimacy, presence, and emotional resonance that make rope feel sacred.

**🤝 Authentic community over surface performance?**  
We value real conversation over rope tricks. Vulnerability over Instagram moments. Being seen for who you are rather than what you can do.

**🕊️ Safety that goes beyond physical technique?**  
We create space for consent that's enthusiastic, ongoing, and held collectively. Emotional safety matters as much as physical safety here.

**🌅 Time to slow down and feel deeply?**  
Four days to step away from rush culture. To breathe. To be present. To let intimacy unfold naturally without agenda or timeline.

### You'll Love This If...

**You're curious about rope** — whether you've never touched it or you've been tying for years. Experience level doesn't matter. Openness does.

**You value consent as an ongoing practice** — not just a checkbox, but a living dialogue that deepens intimacy and trust.

**You want to connect with like-minded people** — folks who see kink as a doorway to deeper humanity, not just a bedroom activity.

**You're comfortable with communal living** — shared meals, bunk beds, morning coffee conversations with people you just met.

**You can hold space for others' emotions** — tears, laughter, overwhelm, and joy are all welcome parts of this experience.

**You're ready to be fully present** — phones away, agendas aside, heart open to whatever wants to emerge.

### This Might Not Be Right If...

**You're looking for a rope workshop or skill-building event** — we're about connection, not curriculum. You'll learn plenty, but through experience rather than instruction.

**You prefer anonymous encounters** — this is intimate, communal, and heart-centered. People see and remember each other here.

**You need privacy and solitude** — we sleep in shared rooms, eat together, and spend most of our time in community.

**You're not ready to engage with emotions** — rope brings up feelings. Ours, others', unexpected ones. We hold that tenderly, but it happens.

**You're uncomfortable witnessing sexual expression** — while no one is required to participate sexually, intimate and sexual interactions will happen around you. If seeing others kiss, touch, or engage sexually makes you uncomfortable or triggers you, this gathering may not be right for you.

**You're seeking a party atmosphere** — this is contemplative, intentional, and sometimes quiet. Fun, yes. Wild party, no.

## Still Wondering?

Ask yourself:

💭 **Does this gathering feel like coming home to something I've been seeking?**

💭 **Am I ready to be vulnerable and hold space for others' vulnerability?**

💭 **Do I want to explore rope as a practice of intimacy and presence?**

💭 **Can I commit to four days of authentic engagement with a community?**

If you're feeling "YES" — even a nervous, excited, uncertain yes — then this might be exactly what you need.

*Ready to see what this looks like in practice?* → [Experience Structure](/concept/experience)

If you're feeling "maybe" or "I'm not sure" — that's perfectly valid too. Trust your instincts. There are many beautiful gatherings in the world. This one might not be yours right now, and that's okay.

You don't need to be ready. You just need to be here.

Come as you are. We'll meet you there.
