Maybe you’ve never been to a rope gathering before.  
Maybe you’ve never been naked in public.  
Maybe you’ve never camped with strangers.  
Maybe you’ve never said out loud that you’re kinky.  
Maybe you’re not even sure if you are.

That’s okay.

You don’t have to arrive confident. Or experienced. Or loud.  
You don’t have to tie. You don’t have to undress. You don’t have to explain.  
You just have to be curious. And kind. And willing to feel.

This is not a place for experts.  
This is a place for the real.

We’ve built Rogue Rope Camp for the ones who want something more. Not flashier. Not sexier. But **truer**.

If you’re worried you won’t know how to start a conversation — you’re not alone. Most of us have felt that. So we’ve created icebreakers, gentle encounters, and open spaces that make it easier to connect. No games, no pressure. Just invitations.

If you’re afraid you’ll be the only one who doesn’t know how it all works — you won’t be. We celebrate beginners. We honor questions. We welcome quiet.

You belong here as you are.

### What if I don’t want to do rope?

That’s fine. Truly. Rope is the thread, not the whole fabric. Some people come just to feel the atmosphere. To connect. To flirt. To cry. To kiss. To watch. To rest.

Rope is welcome. Not required.

### What if I’m coming alone?

A lot of people do. We’ll help you find your way in. Whether through shared meals, structured play spaces, or spontaneous moments around the fire, there are many ways to connect — slowly, gently, honestly.

You might leave with people you didn’t know you needed.

---

### What if I feel overwhelmed?

We expect that. This experience can be intense. There are quiet places, kind volunteers, and soft hands if you need them. You can always step away, lie down, take a breath, cry, laugh, or ask for help.

Consent means you get to choose — every time.

You don’t need to be ready. You just need to be here.

Come as you are. We’ll meet you there.
