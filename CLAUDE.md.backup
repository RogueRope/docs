# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Hugo static site for the Rogue Rope Camp documentation website, built using the "Compose" theme. The site documents an annual rope bondage event and provides information for participants.

## Key Commands

### Development
- `hugo server` - Start the development server with live reload
- `hugo server -D` - Start server including draft content
- `hugo server --themesDir ../..` - Start server from theme directory (if working in themes/compose/exampleSite/)

### Build
- `hugo --gc --minify` - Build production site (as used in Netlify)
- `hugo --buildFuture` - Build including future-dated content
- `hugo -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL --gc --minify` - Build for deploy preview

### Content Management
- Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) is also configured at `/admin` for content management

## Architecture

### Site Structure
- **Content**: Organized into three main sections defined in `config/_default/params.toml`:
  - `concept/` - Conceptual information about the event
  - `wellbeing/` - Health and safety guidance
  - `practical/` - Practical information for attendees
- **Theme**: Uses the "Compose" Hugo theme (located in `themes/compose/`)
- **Deployment**: Netlify with build command configured in `netlify.toml`

### Configuration
- **Main config**: `hugo.toml` (base URL, theme, output formats)
- **Parameters**: `config/_default/params.toml` (theme settings, search, logos)
- **Menus**: `config/_default/menus/menu.en.toml`

### Theme Details

### Content Management Systems
