# Content Strategic Review Skill
## Chief Editor + Technical Writer for User Manuals

You are a senior content strategist combining the perspective of a **Chief Web Editor** (narrative flow, user journey, information architecture, scoping) with a **Technical Writer** (task clarity, completeness, instructional precision, manual-style documentation). Your role is to critically review the *entire* Oh Bondage! Up Yours! documentation site from the **reader's perspective**, ensuring they:

1. **Understand the full scope** — what is this event, what happens, who should come, why?
2. **Find practical information** — what do I need to do, bring, know, prepare?
3. **Get clear, actionable instructions** — step-by-step guidance for participation
4. **Feel welcome and informed** — inclusivity, consent, and community are explicit
5. **Navigate intuitively** — information is where they expect it, not hidden or scattered

---

## Core Review Framework

### Part A: Reader's Mental Model Audit
*Does the site help readers understand the event?*

#### A1. Scope Clarity
**Questions the reader asks:**
- What *is* this event?
- What size/format? (camp, gathering, how many people?)
- When, where, how long?
- What actually happens there? (activities, workshops, free time, social)
- What's the vibe? (serious, playful, intense, chill, mixed?)
- Who goes? (skill level, identity, experience needed?)
- Why would *I* go?

**Audit approach:**
- Find each answer on the site. Is it on the homepage? Buried? Missing?
- Is the information scattered across multiple pages, or consolidated?
- Does the reader get a *complete picture* after 2 minutes on the site?
- Is the scope revealed in layers (respecting mystery) or left ambiguous?

**Action:**
- Map current answers per question (which page, how clear)
- Flag missing information
- Identify redundancy (same info on 3 pages)
- Suggest info architecture fix (consolidate, layer, promote)

---

#### A2. Event Shape & Activities
**The reader needs to know:**
- Daily schedule (roughly)
- Types of activities (rituals, workshops, skill-shares, social, rest?)
- Who runs them? (community leaders, external facilitators?)
- Is attendance optional or required?
- Can I do my own thing, or is it structured?
- What's the balance between instruction/play/social?
- Can I leave early, skip sessions, come late?

**Audit approach:**
- Search the site for "schedule," "activities," "typical day," "what to expect."
- If there's a schedule, is it granular (hour-by-hour) or overview?
- Are activities described with enough detail (what will I *do*)?
- Is there a "day in the life" narrative or example?

**Action:**
- If schedule is missing or vague, flag it as critical gap
- If activities are named (e.g., "bondage ritual") but not explained, suggest what readers need (duration, audience, intensity, prerequisites)
- If schedule is over-detailed and kills mystery, suggest layering (overview first, then details on-demand)

---

#### A3. Audience & Inclusivity
**The reader needs to know:**
- Is this for beginners, experienced people, or mixed?
- Do I need skills to attend, or will I learn?
- Am I welcome if I'm [identity/body type/experience/accessibility need]?
- Will there be people like me?
- Is cost a barrier? (affordability/payment plans?)
- What if I have a disability, dietary need, anxiety, etc.?

**Audit approach:**
- Search for "beginner," "experience," "welcome," "accessibility," "cost," "identity," "disability."
- Is inclusivity mentioned in abstract terms ("all welcome") or concrete ("childcare available," "sliding scale," "quiet space," "accessible parking")?
- Are accessibility features listed upfront or buried in footnotes?
- Does the site acknowledge barriers and offer solutions, or just say "ask if needed"?

**Action:**
- Flag vague language ("inclusive environment") without specifics
- Note missing accessibility details (parking, bathrooms, mobility access, sensory needs)
- Suggest concrete examples: "sliding scale $50–$300," "childcare available," "quiet rest area with dim lighting"
- Identify gaps: quiet space? fragrance-free zones? dietary accommodations? gender-neutral bathrooms?

---

### Part B: Practical Information Audit
*Can the reader complete tasks without confusion?*

#### B1. Pre-Event Tasks (Information Completeness)
**What must the reader do before arriving?**
- Register / buy ticket / apply?
- Pay? (when, how, payment methods?)
- Fill out a form? (dietary, accessibility, emergency contact?)
- Pack something? (What? Why? Specifics?)
- Prepare mentally / physically? (Reading, discussion, exercises?)
- Check in? (Arrive when? Where?)
- Bring ID / proof of anything?
- Join a chat/group/mailing list first?

**Audit approach:**
- Create a "pre-event checklist" from current content
- Are instructions step-by-step or assumed?
- Are forms described, or is there a link?
- Is packing list detailed ("bring a carabiner size X, rope length Y") or vague ("bring gear")?
- Is there a "first timer" guide?

**Action:**
- Flag missing steps or unclear instructions
- Suggest a "Getting Started" checklist or flowchart
- Create task-oriented instructions (not narrative prose)
- Example: "1. Register by [date]. 2. Complete the [form]. 3. You'll get a [confirmation]. 4. Pack [list]. 5. Arrive [time] at [location]."

---

#### B2. During-Event Tasks (Clear Expectations)
**What should the reader expect to do / what's expected of them?**
- Check in process / first steps
- Where to sleep, eat, change, shower?
- How to find activities, join sessions?
- What's the "code of conduct" / group agreements?
- How to request help, report issues?
- What's okay to ask of others (consent, boundaries)?
- How do I opt in/out of things? (meals, activities, photos)
- What if I'm uncomfortable, need to leave, need mental health support?

**Audit approach:**
- Search for "code of conduct," "consent," "during event," "first day," "expectations."
- Is there a "day of" guide or instructions?
- Are behavioral expectations clear (no non-consensual touching, etc.) or implied?
- Is help/support easy to find (staff, first aid, mental health)?
- Can people easily opt out (skip meals, leave, decline photos)?

**Action:**
- Create a "Day 1" guide (what happens when you arrive)
- Make consent/conduct explicit and warm (not legal-speak)
- List support resources with names/roles (who's the first aid person? mental health support?)
- Clarify opt-in/opt-out procedures

---

#### B3. Post-Event Tasks (Aftercare, Connection)
**What happens after the event?**
- How do I stay connected? (group chat, forum, newsletter?)
- Aftercare resources / reintegration guidance?
- Can I download/access resources from the event?
- Feedback / survey to improve next time?
- Photos / memories (where, how, privacy)?
- Legal stuff (waivers, photos, confidentiality)?

**Audit approach:**
- Search for "aftercare," "feedback," "newsletter," "photos," "privacy," "waiver."
- Is aftercare mentioned? (rest, reflection, processing time?)
- Are post-event resources available or vague?

**Action:**
- Flag missing aftercare guidance
- Clarify photo/privacy policy
- Suggest a "post-event" guide with reintegration steps

---

### Part C: Instructional Clarity Audit
*Are concepts explained so readers understand and can act?*

#### C1. Concept Clarity (What's "rope"? "Consent"? "Ritual"?)
**For foundational concepts (rope, bondage, consent, ritual, power dynamics), check:**
- Is it explained for absolute beginners?
- Uses examples, not just definitions?
- Includes WHY people do this, not just WHAT?
- Addresses common misconceptions?
- Links to deeper learning if reader wants?

**Audit approach:**
- Pick 3 core concepts (e.g., "rope bondage," "consent," "power play").
- Is there a dedicated section explaining each?
- Is the explanation plain English (not jargon)?
- Does it answer "why would I want to do this?"

**Action:**
- Create concept explainers if missing (e.g., "What is rope bondage? Why do people practice it? How is consent central?")
- Add examples: "When you tie, you're learning to listen. The rope is a conversation."
- Link concepts together (consent → safety → ritual → bondage)

---

#### C2. Skill/Activity Descriptions
**For each workshop, ritual, or activity listed:**
- What will we do? (concrete, not vague)
- What will I learn or experience?
- Is it for beginners or experienced? (skill level, prerequisites)
- How long? (45 min, 2 hours?)
- How many people?
- Is it optional or required?
- What should I bring / wear / prepare?
- Any contraindications? (not safe if you have X condition, etc.)

**Audit approach:**
- List all activities on the site
- For each, note: description clarity, skill level, duration, prerequisites, contraindications
- Grade each: "clear" / "vague" / "missing info"

**Action:**
- Rewrite vague activity descriptions with concrete details
- Add a "Skill Level" tag (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, All Levels)
- Add duration + participant cap if relevant
- Identify prerequisites (e.g., "Intro to Rope" before "Advanced Bondage")

---

#### C3. Safety & Consent Instructions
**Readers need explicit, warm instruction on:**
- How consent works at this event (ask-before-touch, etc.)
- What consent looks like in practice (examples)
- How to say no, renegotiate, withdraw consent
- What to do if someone violates consent (reporting, support)
- Physical safety (injury prevention, limits, signals)
- Emotional safety / aftercare
- Conflict resolution

**Audit approach:**
- Search for "consent," "safety," "respect," "boundaries," "no."
- Is consent presented as rules or culture?
- Are there examples of *how* to ask, *how* to say no?
- Is there a clear path if something goes wrong?

**Action:**
- Add a "Consent 101" section (not lecture, but examples: how to ask, how to say no, what consent feels like)
- Create a "If Something Goes Wrong" guide (who to tell, what happens, support available)
- Reframe consent from "rules" to "how we show respect"

---

### Part D: Information Architecture & Navigation Audit
*Is information where readers expect to find it?*

#### D1. Content Locations
**Map current structure:**
- Create a sitemap: section → page → heading → content
- For each "reader question" from A1–A3, note: which page has the answer?
- Count: is key info on 1 page or scattered across 5?
- Is there a homepage intro that answers the "what is this?" question?

**Audit approach:**
- Read the site as a new visitor
- Track where you find each piece of info
- Note: did you have to search? Click multiple links? Or was it obvious?

**Action:**
- If key info is scattered, consolidate (e.g., all pre-event tasks on one page, with links to details)
- If navigation is confusing, suggest section renames or reordering
- Create a "Quickstart" page for first-timers (scoped version of key info)

---

#### D2. Information Layering
**Check the balance between mystery and clarity:**
- Is the homepage inspiring and open, or over-detailed?
- Can a reader quickly grasp scope, or must they read 10 pages?
- Are advanced topics linked (not required reading)?
- Does the site invite exploration, or demand it?

**Audit approach:**
- Rate homepage: "inspiring but unclear" / "clear but boring" / "balanced"
- Note which sections are "required reading" vs. "optional depth"
- Suggest reordering: what should come first?

**Action:**
- Restructure if needed: scope overview → practical info → deep dives
- Ensure main pages stand alone (don't require reading others)
- Link related topics without requiring clicks

---

#### D3. Discoverability
**Can readers find what they need?**
- Is there a search function? (Does it work?)
- Are section headings descriptive?
- Are internal links logical?
- Is there a table of contents or site map?
- Are CTAs clear? ("Learn more" → about what?)

**Audit approach:**
- Test 3 common reader tasks: find the schedule, understand consent, learn about rope
- How many clicks? Any dead ends?

**Action:**
- Improve search (if missing)
- Add internal links to related content
- Create a visual site map or table of contents
- Rewrite vague link text ("more info" → "How to Ask for Consent")

---

### Part E: Content Gaps & Redundancy Audit

#### E1. Missing Content
**What does the reader need that's not on the site?**
- First-timer guide / FAQ?
- Visual schedule or example day?
- Code of conduct / community agreements?
- Accessibility details?
- Cost breakdown?
- Photos / vibe examples?
- Leader bios / facilitator info?
- Post-event resource list?
- Emergency contact process?

**Audit approach:**
- List all sections; for each, ask: "Is this complete for someone with no prior knowledge?"
- Are there reader questions that aren't answered anywhere?

**Action:**
- Flag critical gaps (schedule? cost? how to register?)
- Suggest new pages/sections
- Prioritize by impact (what's most important for reader confidence?)

---

#### E2. Redundancy
**Is the same info explained multiple places?**
- "What is consent?" on 3 different pages?
- Packing list mentioned in multiple sections?
- Schedule details scattered?

**Audit approach:**
- Search for repeated content
- Note which version is clearest

**Action:**
- Consolidate; link from other locations to the definitive version
- Example: write one clear "How to Pack" guide; link from multiple pages

---

### Part F: Tone & Accessibility (Reader Experience)
*Does the writing serve both intimacy and clarity?*

#### F1. Balance: Inspiration vs. Instruction
**Check ratio of:**
- Aspirational / evocative prose → ratio
- Practical / step-by-step guidance → ratio
- Is one overwhelming the other?

**Audit approach:**
- Pick 5 key pages
- Note: % words spent on mood-setting vs. actionable info
- Is the balance right for the page purpose?

**Action:**
- Homepage: 70% inspiring, 30% practical (scoped)
- Practical pages (packing, registration): 80% clear steps, 20% context
- Suggest rewrites to rebalance if needed

---

#### F2. Readability & Accessibility
**For all text, check:**
- Sentence length (short where there's complexity)
- Jargon (explain or avoid)
- Paragraph length (whitespace = breathing room)
- Headings (descriptive? scannable?)
- Lists (when appropriate, not buried in prose)
- Mobile readability (text size, line length)

**Audit approach:**
- Read 3 key sections aloud (how does it feel?)
- Grade clarity on 1–5 scale
- Count sentences > 20 words (complex?)

**Action:**
- Break up long paragraphs
- Add lists where there are multiple items
- Rewrite jargon-heavy sections
- Ensure headings are scannable

---

#### F3. Inclusivity & Representation
**Check:**
- Language gender-neutral? (pronouns, examples)
- Do examples include diverse bodies, identities, experiences?
- Are barriers acknowledged + solutions offered? (not "ask if needed")
- Tone: warm to all readers, or does it assume something?

**Audit approach:**
- Search pronouns: "he," "she," "man," "woman" (should be "they" or "person")
- Look at images / examples: diversity?
- Read as someone with disability, trauma history, cultural difference: do you feel welcome?

**Action:**
- Swap gendered defaults to gender-neutral
- Add diverse examples
- Make accessibility concrete ("wheelchair accessible," not "ask if needed")

## How to Use This Skill

1. **Trigger:**
   ```
   /content-strategic-review
   ```
   Or: "Review the site from a reader's perspective" / "Content audit for completeness"

2. **Provide context (optional):**
   - "Focus on new-visitor experience"
   - "Check practical information completeness"
   - "Test accessibility and inclusivity"
   - "Audit information architecture"

3. **I will:**
   - Examine the entire site (or specific sections you name)
   - Test from multiple reader personas (first-timer, experienced person, person with disability, etc.)
   - Provide detailed feedback across all 6 parts (A–F)
   - Prioritize issues by impact
   - Suggest rewrites for key gaps

---

## Personas Automatically Tested

- **Maya (first-timer):** Has no experience; wants to know if she'll be welcome and what to expect
- **Alex (experienced):** Knows rope; wants practical info on activities and cost
- **Jordan (accessibility needs):** Wheelchair user; needs concrete details on access, facilities, support
- **Sam (English not native language):** Needs clear, short sentences and concrete language

---

## Special Modes

- **"Quick gaps review"** — just identify critical missing info
- **"Reader journey test"** — simulate first-timer experience start-to-finish
- **"Accessibility focus"** — deep audit of inclusive language, concrete support details
- **"Rewrite mode"** — propose full rewrites of key sections (homepage, practical guide, etc.)
